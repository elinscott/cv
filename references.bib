  abstract = {The design of correlated materials challenges researchers to combine the maturing, high throughput framework of DFT-based materials design with the rapidly-developing first-principles theory for correlated electron systems. We review the field of correlated materials, distinguishing two broad classes of correlation effects, static and dynamics, and describe methodologies to take them into account. We introduce a material design workflow, and illustrate it via examples in several materials classes, including superconductors, charge ordering materials and systems near an electronically driven metal to insulator transition, highlighting the interplay between theory and experiment with a view towards finding new materials. We review the statistical formulation of the errors of currently available methods to estimate formation energies. Correlation effects have to be considered in all the material design steps. These include bridging between structure and property, obtaining the correct structure and predicting material stability. We introduce a post-processing strategy to take them into account.}

It supplies tools and methods to construct Wannier functions and to perform the DMFT self-consistency cycle in this basis set. Post-processing tools, such as band-structure plotting or the calculation of transport properties are also implemented.

The singlet state of the \$\$\{\{\textbackslash rm\{Cu\}\}\}\_\{2\}\{\{\textbackslash rm\{O\}\}\}\_\{2\}\$\$Cu2O2 core is thought to be stabilised by a superexchange pathway, but detailed in situ computational analysis is complicated by the multi-reference character of the electronic ground state. Here, electronic correlation effects in the functional site of hemocyanin are investigated using a novel approach, treating the localised copper 3d electrons with cluster dynamical mean field theory. This enables us to account for dynamical and multi-reference quantum mechanics, capturing valence and spin fluctuations of the 3d electrons. Our approach explains the stabilisation of the experimentally observed di-Cu singlet for the butterflied \$\$\{\{\textbackslash rm\{Cu\}\}\}\_\{2\}\{\{\textbackslash rm\{O\}\}\}\_\{2\}\$\$Cu2O2 core, with localised charge and incoherent scattering processes across the oxo-bridge that prevent long-lived charge excitations. This suggests that the magnetic structure of hemocyanin is largely influenced by the many-body corrections.},

However, it remains to be established whether ``diffraction-before-destruction'' is actually accomplished or if significant changes are produced by the high-intensity X-ray pulses during the femtosecond scattering measurement. Here, we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the extent of structural changes induced on the femtosecond time scale. We found that the radiation damage is dependent on the bonding and charge of each atom in the OEC, in a manner that may provide lessons for XFEL studies of other metalloproteins.

Amunts et al. determined the high-resolution structures of complete mammalian mitoribosomes using cryoelectron microscopy. Mitoribosomes include an unusual mRNA binding channel. The findings elucidate how aminoglycoside antibiotics can inadvertently inhibit mitoribosomes and how mutations in mitoribosomes can lead to disease.Science, this issue p. 95The highly divergent ribosomes of human mitochondria (mitoribosomes) synthesize 13 essential proteins of oxidative phosphorylation complexes. We have determined the structure of the intact mitoribosome to 3.5 angstrom resolution by means of single-particle electron cryogenic microscopy. It reveals 80 extensively interconnected proteins, 36 of which are specific to mitochondria, and three ribosomal RNA molecules. The head domain of the small subunit, particularly the messenger (mRNA) channel, is highly remodeled. Many intersubunit bridges are specific to the mitoribosome, which adopts conformations involving ratcheting or rolling of the small subunit that are distinct from those seen in bacteria or eukaryotes. An intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase mediates a contact between the head and central protuberance. The structure provides a reference for analysis of mutations that cause severe pathologies and for future drug design.}

This distinction is useful from the magnetic point of view because in insulators the spins and magnetic moments whose alignments lead to magnetic effects are certainly localizable so that phenomenologically is described by a spin Hamiltonian that contains spin operators and exchange terms of Heisenberg type. It discusses that there is relationship among the mechanisms important in metals, such as conduction electron polarization, and those in insulators. The chapter provides historical discussion of the subjects of antiferromagnetism and of exchange in insulators. It focuses on the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with a brief derivation and a discussion of some of the statistical theories of magnetism based upon it, primarily molecular field theory, which is by far the most generally useful in the experimental measurement of exchange. The chapter also describes older theories and presents ideas about super-exchange, and gives a discussion and a diagrammatic classification of all the possible higher-order processes.},

We first recast the problem in terms of induced polarization charges that act as a direct mapping of the self-consistent continuum dielectric; this allows to define a functional form for the dielectric that is well behaved both in the high-density region of the nuclear charges and in the low-density region where the electronic wavefunctions decay into the solvent.

The LDA+U method takes into account orbital dependence of the Coulomb and exchange interactions which is absent in the LDA. The scheme can be regarded as a `first-principles' method because there are no adjustable parameters. When applied to the transition metal and rare-earth metal compounds, the LDA+U method gives a qualitative improvement compared with the LDA not only for excited-state properties such as energy gaps but also for ground-state properties such as magnetic moments and interatomic exchange parameters. The orbital-dependent rotationally invariant LDA+U potential gives a correct orbital polarization and a corresponding Jahn - Teller distortion as well as polaron formation.}

  abstract = {The local density approximation (LDA) to the density functional theory (DFT) has a continuous derivative of the total energy as a function of the number of electrons and continuous exchange--correlation potential, while in exact DFT both functions should be discontinuous as the number of electrons goes through an integer value. We propose an ad hoc orbital density functional (ODF) (with orbitals defined as Wannier functions) that by construction obeys this discontinuity condition. Taking its variation, the one-electron equations are obtained with a potential in the form of a projection operator. This operator increases the separation between occupied and empty bands, thus curing an LDA deficiency---systematic underestimation of the energy gap value. The minimization of the ODF gives the ground-state orbital and total electron densities. In addition to that we define the ODF fluctuation Hamiltonian that allows one to treat dynamical correlation effects. The dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method for an effective impurity problem was used to solve this Hamiltonian. We have applied the ODF method to the problem of the metal--insulator transition in lanthanum trihydride LaH3-x. In the LDA calculations for all values of hydrogen nonstoichiometry x the ground state of this material is metallic, while experimentally the system is insulating for x{$<$}0.3. The ODF method gave a paramagnetic insulator solution for LaH3 and LaH2.75 but metallic state for LaH2.5.},

In biology, generation of fuel due to water oxidation happens efficiently on an immense scale during the light reactions of photosynthesis. To oxidize water, photosynthetic organisms have evolved a highly conserved protein complex, Photosystem II. Within that complex, water oxidation happens at the CaMn4O5 inorganic catalytic cluster, the so-called oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), which cycles through storage ``S'' states as it accumulates oxidizing equivalents and produces molecular oxygen. In recent years, there has been significant progress in understanding the OEC as it evolves through the catalytic cycle.

For the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) hybrid family of exchange-correlation functionals (i.e., for an approximate generalized Kohn-Sham theory) this implies that (i) the highest occupied molecular orbital corresponds to the ionization potential (I), (ii) the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital corresponds to the electron affinity (A), and (iii) the energies of the frontier orbitals are constant as a function of their occupation. In agreement with a previous study [N. Sai et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 226403 (2011)], we find that these conditions are met for high values of the exact exchange admixture {$\alpha$} and illustrate their importance for the tetrathiafulvalene-tetracyanoquinodimethane complex for which standard density functional theory functionals predict artificial electron transfer. We further assess the performance for atomization energies and weak interaction energies. We find that atomization energies are significantly underestimated compared to PBE or PBE0, whereas the description of weak interaction energies improves significantly if a 1/R6 van der Waals correction scheme is employed.}

  abstract = {Many references exist in the density functional theory (DFT) literature to the chemical potential of the electrons in an atom or a molecule. The origin of this notion has been the identification of the Lagrange multiplier \$\textbackslash mu = \textbackslash partial E/\textbackslash partial N\$ in the Euler-Lagrange variational equation for the ground state density as the chemical potential of the electrons. We first discuss why the Lagrange multiplier in this case is an arbitrary constant and therefore cannot be a physical characteristic of an atom or molecule. The switching of the energy derivative ("chemical potential") from \$-I\$ to \$-A\$ when the electron number crosses the integer, called integer discontinuity or derivative discontinuity, is not physical but only occurs when the nonphysical noninteger electron systems and the corresponding energy and derivative \$\textbackslash partial E/\textbackslash partial N\$ are chosen in a specific discontinuous way. The question is discussed whether in fact the thermodynamical concept of a chemical potential can be defined for the electrons in such few-electron systems as atoms and molecules. The conclusion is that such systems lack important characteristics of thermodynamic systems and do not afford the definition of a chemical potential. They also cannot be considered as analogues of the open systems of thermodynamics that can exchange particles with an environment (a particles bath or other members of a Gibbsian ensemble). Thermodynamical (statistical mechanical) concepts like chemical potential, open systems, grand canonical ensemble etc. are not applicable to a few electron system like an atom or molecule. A number of topics in DFT are critically reviewed in the light of these findings: jumps in the Kohn-Sham potential when crossing an integer number of electrons, the band gap problem, the deviation-from-straight-lines error, the role of ensembles in DFT.},

  abstract = {The flat-plane condition is the union of two exact constraints in electronic structure theory: (i) energetic piecewise linearity with fractional electron removal or addition and (ii) invariant energetics with change in electron spin in a half filled orbital. Semi-local density functional theory (DFT) fails to recover the flat plane, exhibiting convex fractional charge errors (FCE) and concave fractional spin errors (FSE) that are related to delocalization and static correlation errors. We previously showed that DFT+U eliminates FCE but now demonstrate that, like other widely employed corrections (i.e., Hartree-Fock exchange), it worsens FSE. To find an alternative strategy, we examine the shape of semi-local DFT deviations from the exact flat plane and we find this shape to be remarkably consistent across ions and molecules. We introduce the judiciously modified DFT (jmDFT) approach, wherein corrections are constructed from few-parameter, low-order functional forms that fit the shape of semi-local DFT err...},

  abstract = {The presence of layered cobalt oxides has been identified experimentally in Co-based anodes under oxygen-evolving conditions. In this work, we report the results of theoretical investigations of the relative stability of layered and spinel bulk phases of Co oxides, as well as the stability of selected surfaces as a function of applied potential and pH. We then study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on these surfaces and obtain activity trends at experimentally relevant electro-chemical conditions. Our calculated volume Pourbaix diagram shows that {$\beta$}-CoOOH is the active phase where the OER occurs in alkaline media. We calculate relative surface stabilities and adsorbate coverages of the most stable low-index surfaces of {$\beta$}-CoOOH: (0001), (01{$\overline 1$}2), and (10{$\overline 1$}4). We find that at low applied potentials, the (10{$\overline 1$}4) surface is the most stable, while the (01{$\overline 1$}2) surface is the more stable at higher potentials. Next, we compare the theoretical overpotentials for all three surfaces and find that the (10{$\overline 1$}4) surface is the most active one as characterized by an overpotential of {$\eta$} = 0.48 V. The high activity of the (10{$\overline 1$}4) surface can be attributed to the observation that the resting state of Co in the active site is Co3+ during the OER, whereas Co is in the Co4+ state in the less active surfaces. Lastly, we demonstrate that the overpotential of the (10{$\overline 1$}4) surface can be lowered further by surface substitution of Co by Ni. This finding could explain the experimentally observed enhancement in the OER activity of NiyCo1--yOx thin films with increasing Ni content. All energetics in this work were obtained from density functional theory using the Hubbard-U correction.}

All the oxygen in the atmosphere is derived from this reaction, and without it the biosphere, as we know it, would not exist. Indeed, the appearance of this catalytic center {$\sim$}3 billion years ago gave rise to the ``big bang of evolution''. Thus, understanding the structure and functioning of this metal cluster is a major topic in science, and here I discuss it in terms of research that has occurred over the past 12 years dating back to when it was first proposed to be a Mn3CaO4 cubane with the fourth Mn attached to cubane by one of its oxo bridging bonds. Since then, a number of novel properties have emerged for this metalloprotein with implications for its catalytic mechanism and evolutionary origin.}

  abstract = {The biological energy cycle of our planet is driven by photosynthesis whereby sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and other acces-sory pigments. The excitation energy is then efficiently transferred to a reaction centre where charge separation occurs in a few picoseconds. In the case of photosystem II (PSII), the energy of the charge transfer state is used to split water into oxygen and reducing equivalents. This is accomplished by the relatively low energy content of four photons of visible light. PSII is a large multi-subunit membrane protein complex embedded in the lipid environment of the thylakoid membranes of plants, algae and cyanobacteria. Four high energy electrons, together with four protons (4H +), are used to reduce plastoquinone (PQ), the terminal electron acceptor of PSII, to plastoquinol (PQH 2). PQH 2 passes its reducing equivalents to an electron transfer chain which feeds into photosystem I (PSI) where they gain additional reducing potential from a second light reaction which is necessary to drive CO 2 reduction. The catalytic centre of PSII consists of a cluster of four Mn ions and a Ca 2+ linked by oxo bonds. In addition, there are seven amino acid ligands. In this Article, I discuss the structure of this metal cluster, its stability and the probability that an acid-base (nucleophilic-electrophilic) mechanism catalyses the water splitting reaction on the surface of the metal-cluster. Evidence for this mechanism is presented from studies on water splitting catalysts consisting of organo-complexes of ruthenium and manganese and also by comparison with the enzymology of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH). Finally the relevance of our under-standing of PSII is discussed in terms of artificial photosynthesis with emphasis on inorganic water splitting catalysts as oxygen generating photoelectrodes.}

Bartesaghi et al. achieved a resolution of 2.2 \AA for a 465-kD ligand-bound protein complex using cryo-EM. The density map is detailed enough to show close to 800 water molecules, magnesium and sodium ions, and precise side-chain conformations. These results bring routine use of cryo-EM in rational drug design a step closer.Science, this issue p. 1147Cryo\{\textbackslash textendash\}electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is rapidly emerging as a powerful tool for protein structure determination at high resolution. Here we report the structure of a complex between Escherichia coli {$\beta$}-galactosidase and the cell-permeant inhibitor phenylethyl {$\beta$}-d-thiogalactopyranoside (PETG), determined by cryo-EM at an average resolution of \textasciitilde 2.2 angstroms (\AA ). Besides the PETG ligand, we identified densities in the map for \textasciitilde 800 water molecules and for magnesium and sodium ions. Although it is likely that continued advances in detector technology may further enhance resolution, our findings demonstrate that preparation of specimens of adequate quality and intrinsic protein flexibility, rather than imaging or image-processing technologies, now represent the major bottlenecks to routinely achieving resolutions close to 2 \AA using single-particle cryo-EM.}

The solver can treat full rotationally invariant interactions with reasonable numerical effort. We show the efficiency and accuracy of the method by a benchmark for the testbed material SrVO\$\_3\$. There we observe multiplet structures in the high-energy spectrum which are almost impossible to resolve by other multi-orbital methods.

  abstract = {Exchange interactions are a manifestation of the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons and play a key role in predicting the properties of materials from first principles. In density functional theory (DFT), a widely used approximation to the exchange energy combines fractions of density-based and Hartree--Fock (exact) exchange. This so-called hybrid DFT scheme is accurate in many materials, for reasons that are not fully understood. Here we show that a 1/4 fraction of exact exchange plus a 3/4 fraction of density-based exchange is compatible with a correct quantum mechanical treatment of the exchange energy of an electron pair in the unpolarized electron gas. We also show that the 1/4 exact-exchange fraction mimics a correlation interaction between doubly-excited electronic configurations. The relation between our results and trends observed in hybrid DFT calculations is discussed, along with other implications.},

  abstract = {The Perdew--Zunger (PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) was designed to correct the one-electron limit of any approximate density functional for the exchange--correlation (xc) energy, while yielding no correction to the exact functional. Unfortunately, it spoils the slowly varying (in space) limits of the uncorrected approximate functionals, where those functionals are right by construction. The right limits can be restored by locally scaling down the energy density of the PZ SIC in many-electron regions, but then a spurious correction to the exact functional would be found unless the self-Hartree and exact self-xc terms of the PZ SIC energy density were expressed in the same gauge. Only the local density approximation satisfies the same-gauge condition for the energy density, which explains why the recent local-scaling SIC is found here to work excellently for atoms and molecules only with this basic approximation and not with the more advanced generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) and meta-GGAs, which lose the Hartree gauge via simplifying integrations by parts. The transformation of energy density that achieves the Hartree gauge for the exact xc functional can also be applied to approximate functionals. Doing so leads to a simple scaled-down self-interaction correction that is typically much more accurate than PZ SIC in tests for many molecular properties (including equilibrium bond lengths). The present work unambiguously shows that the largest errors of PZ SIC applied to standard functionals at three levels of approximation can be removed by restoring their correct slowly varying density limits. It also confirms the relevance of these limits to atoms and molecules.}

  abstract = {Semilocal density-functional approximations (DFAs), including the state-of-the-art SCAN functional, are plagued by the self-interaction error (SIE). While this error is explicitly defined only for one-electron systems, it has inspired the self-interaction correction method proposed by Perdew and Zunger (PZ-SIC), which has shown promise in mitigating the many-electron SIE. However, the PZ-SIC method is known for its significant numerical instability. In this study, we introduce a novel constraint that facilitates self-consistent localization of the SIC orbitals in the spirit of Edmiston--Ruedenberg orbitals [Rev. Mod. Phys. 35, 457 (1963)]. Our practical implementation within the all-electron numeric atom-centered orbitals code FHI-aims guarantees efficient and stable convergence of the self-consistent PZ-SIC equations for both molecules and solids. We further demonstrate that our PZ-SIC approach effectively mitigates the SIE in the meta-generalized gradient approximation SCAN functional, significantly improving the accuracy for ionization potentials, charge-transfer energies, and bandgaps for a diverse selection of molecules and solids. However, our PZ-SIC method does have its limitations. It cannot improve the already accurate SCAN results for properties such as cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk modulus in our test sets. This highlights the need for new-generation DFAs with more comprehensive applicability.}

For oxidation of carbon monoxide at low temperature, catalysts comprising small ({$<$}5 nm) gold particles supported preferably on an oxide of the first transition series (e.g., TiO2, {$\alpha$}-Fe2O3) are needed. Deposition--precipitation and coprecipitation are better methods than impregnation for this purpose and provide the desired intimacy of contact between metal and support. High activity may well originate at sites at the gold--support interface, with the support making a vital contribution.

At variance with functionals of the total density, orbital-density-dependent functionals are typically not invariant with respect to unitary transformations of the occupied states. Such additional degrees of freedom require an extension of established approaches for direct minimization that preserve their numerical robustness and efficiency, and make it possible to apply these advanced electronic-structure functionals to large or complex systems. In this work we adapt the ensemble-DFT algorithm [N. Marzari, D. Vanderbilt, and M. C. Payne, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 1337 (1997)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.79.1337] to the case of orbital-density-dependent functionals, partitioning the variational problem into a nested loop of (i) minimizations with respect to unitary transformations at a fixed orbital manifold, that lead to a projected, unitary-covariant functional of the orbitals only that enforces the Pederson condition and (ii) variational optimization of the orbital manifold for this projected functional. We discuss in detail both general and functional-dependent trends and suggest a procedure to efficiently exploit the combination of the different minimization strategies. The overall formulation allows for a stable, robust, and efficient algorithm, yielding great improvements over conventional techniques.}

Myoglobin (Mb) is the paradigm to investigate conformational dynamics because it is a simple globular heme protein displaying a photosensitivity of the iron-ligand bond. Upon laser photodissociation of carboxymyoglobin Mb a nonequilibrium population of protein structures is generated that relaxes over a broad time range extending from picoseconds to milliseconds. This process is associated with migration of the ligand to cavities in the matrix and with a reduction in the geminate rebinding rate by several orders of magnitude. Here we report nanosecond time-resolved Laue diffraction data to 1.55-A resolution on a Mb mutant, which depicts the sequence of structural events associated with this extended relaxation. Motions of the distal E-helix, including the mutated residue Gln-64(E7), and of the CD-turn are found to lag significantly (100-300 ns) behind local rearrangements around the heme such as heme tilting, iron motion out of the heme plane, and swinging of the mutated residue Tyr-29(B10), all of which occur promptly ({$<$} or =3 ns). Over the same delayed time range, CO is observed to migrate from a cavity distal to the heme known to bind xenon (called Xe4) to another such cavity proximal to the heme (Xe1). We propose that the extended relaxation of the globin moiety reflects reequilibration among conformational substates known to play an essential role in controlling protein function.}

Here, we have studied the transition between the low spin (LS) and high spin (HS) configurations of S2 using EPR spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT), and time-resolved UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The EPR experiments show that the equilibrium between S2LS and S2HS is pH dependent, with a pKa\,{$\approx$}\,8.3 (n\,{$\approx$}\,4) for the native Mn4CaO5 and pKa\,{$\approx$}\,7.5 (n\,{$\approx$}\,1) for Mn4SrO5. The DFT results suggest that exchanging Ca with Sr modifies the electronic structure of several titratable groups within the active site, including groups that are not direct ligands to Ca/Sr, e.g., W1/W2, Asp61, His332 and His337. This is consistent with the complex modification of the pKa upon the Ca/Sr exchange. EPR also showed that NH3 addition reversed the effect of high pH, NH3-S2LS being present at all pH values studied. Absorption spectroscopy indicates that NH3 is no longer bound in the S3TyrZ state, consistent with EPR data showing minor or no NH3-induced modification of S3 and S0. In both Ca-PSII and Sr-PSII, S2HS was capable of advancing to S3 at low temperature (198\,K). This is an experimental demonstration that the S2LS is formed first and advances to S3 via the S2HS state without detectable intermediates. We discuss the nature of the changes occurring in the S2LS to S2HS transition which allow the S2HS to S3 transition to occur below 200\,K. This work also provides a protocol for generating S3 in concentrated samples without the need for saturating flashes.}

We describe the electronic structure of the metallic and both insulating phases of VO2, and propose a distinct mechanism for the gap opening. We show that Mott physics plays an essential role in all phases of VO2: undimerized vanadium atoms undergo classical Mott transition through local moment formation (in the M2 phase), while strong superexchange within V dimers adds significant dynamic intersite correlations, which remove the singularity of self-energy for dimerized V atoms. The resulting transition from rutile to dimerized M1 phase is adiabatically connected to the Peierls-like transition, but is better characterized as the Mott transition in the presence of strong intersite exchange. As a consequence of Mott physics, the gap in the dimerized M1 phase is temperature dependent. The sole increase of electronic temperature collapses the gap, reminiscent of recent experiments.}

Then, for all of these 100 molecules, we calculate the HOMO energy within second and third-order perturbation theory (PT2 and PT3), and, GW as post-Hartree-Fock methods. We found GW to be the most accurate of these three approximations for the ionization potential, by far. Going beyond GW by adding more diagrams is a tedious and dangerous activity: We tried to complement GW with second-order exchange (SOX), with second-order screened exchange (SOSEX), with interacting electron-hole pairs (WTDHF), and with a GW density-matrix ({$\gamma$}GW). Only the {$\gamma$}GW result has a positive impact. Finally using an improved hybrid functional for the non-interacting Green's function, considering it as a cheap way to approximate self-consistency, the accuracy of the simplest GW approximation improves even more. We conclude that GW is a miracle: Its subtle balance makes GW both accurate and fast.}

Bu\v cko, S. Leb\`egue, J. Hafner, and J. \'Angy\'an, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 9, 4293 (2013)]. The standard Hirshfeld method uses neutral atoms as a reference, whereas in the iterative Hirshfeld (HI) scheme the fractionally charged atomic reference states are determined self-consistently. We show that the HI method predicts more realistic AIM charges and that the TS/HI approach leads to polarizabilities and C6 dispersion coefficients in ionic or partially ionic systems which are, as expected, larger for anions than for cations (in contrast to the conventional TS method). For crystalline materials, the new algorithm predicts polarizabilities per unit cell in better agreement with the values derived from the Clausius-Mosotti equation. The applicability of the TS/HI method has been tested for a wide variety of molecular and solid-state systems. It is demonstrated that for systems dominated by covalent interactions and/or dispersion forces the TS/HI method leads to the same results as the conventional TS approach. The difference between the TS/HI and TS approaches increases with increasing ionicity. A detailed comparison is presented for isoelectronic series of octet compounds, layered crystals, complex intermetallic compounds, and hydrides, and for crystals built of molecules or containing molecular anions. It is demonstrated that only the TS/HI method leads to accurate results for systems where both electrostatic and dispersion interactions are important, as illustrated for Li-intercalated graphite and for molecular adsorption on the surfaces in ionic solids and in the cavities of zeolites.}

Using the infinite-separation-limit technique, this Communication proves the convexity condition for any formulation of DFT that is (1) exact for all v-representable densities, (2) size-consistent, and (3) translationally invariant. An analogous result is also proven for one-body reduced density matrix functional theory. While there are known DFT formulations in which the ground state is not always accessible, indicating that convexity does not hold in such cases, this proof, nonetheless, confirms a stringent constraint on the exact exchange--correlation functional. We also provide sufficient conditions for convexity in approximate DFT, which could aid in the development of density-functional approximations. This result lifts a standing assumption in the proof of the piecewise linearity condition with respect to electron count, which has proven central to understanding the Kohn--Sham bandgap and the exchange--correlation derivative discontinuity of DFT.}

  abstract = {Burgess et al. have recently introduced the BLOR corrective exchange-correlation functional that is, by construction, the unique simplified rotationally-invariant DFT+U functional that enforces the flat-plane condition separately on each effective orbital of a localized subspace. Detached from the Hubbard model, functionals of this type are both double-counting correction free and, when optimized in situ using appropriate error quantifiers, effectively parameter free. In this work, the extension of the BLOR functional to address many-body errors (mBLOR) is derived. The mBLOR functional is built to enforce the flat-plane condition on the entire subspace, rather than on each orbital individually. In this way inter-orbital errors are corrected on the same footing as the single-particle ones. Focusing on exact test cases with strong inter-orbital interactions, the BLOR and mBLOR functionals were benchmarked against contemporary DFT+U functionals using the total energy extensivity condition on stretched homo-nuclear p-block dimers that represent various self-interaction and static-correlation error regimes. The BLOR functional outperformed all other DFT+\$U\$ functionals tested, which often act to increase total-energy errors, yet it still yielded large errors in some systems. mBLOR instead yielded low energy errors across all four strongly-correlated dimers, while being constructed using only semi-local approximation ingredients. As mBLOR would not otherwise introduce a band-gap correction in the manner that is a desirable feature of DFT+U, we developed a cost-free technique to reintroduce it automatically by moving the functional's unusual explicit derivative discontinuity into the potential. With this in place, mBLOR is the only known DFT\$+U\$ functional that opens the bandgap of stretched neutral homo-nuclear dimers without the aid of unphysical spin-symmetry breaking.},

Using this new development, the formation energies of defects in 3C--SiC (silicon carbide) were calculated and compared to more standard DFT calculations. Differences of up to 1 eV were seen between DFT and DFT-SIC calculations of the formation energies. When compared to DFT, DFT-SIC produced less-stable vacancies and silicon interstitials, and more stable antisites and carbon interstitials.

  abstract = {The design of better exchange-correlation (XC) functionals for Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a central challenge of modern electronic structure theory. However, current developments are limited by the mathematical form of the functional, with efficient semi-local functionals being inaccurate for many technologically important systems and the more accurate hybrid functionals being too expensive for large solid-state systems due to the use of the exact exchange operator. In this work, we use physics-informed machine learning to design an exchange functional that is both orbital-dependent and nonlocal, but which can be evaluated at roughly the cost of semi-local functionals and is significantly faster than hybrid DFT in plane-wave codes. By training functionals with several different feature sets, we elucidate the roles of orbital-dependent and nonlocal features in learning the exchange energy and determine that both types of features provide vital and independently important information to the model. Having trained our new exchange functional with an expressive, nonlocal feature set, we substitute it into existing hybrid functionals to achieve hybrid-DFT accuracy on thermochemical benchmark sets and improve the accuracy of band gap predictions over semi-local DFT. To demonstrate the scalability of our approach as well as the practical benefits of improved band gap prediction, we compute charged defect transition levels in silicon using large supercells. Due to its transferability and computational efficiency for both molecular and extended systems, our model overcomes the cost-accuracy trade-off between semi-local and hybrid DFT, and our general approach provides a feasible path toward a universal exchange-correlation functional with post-hybrid DFT accuracy and semi-local DFT cost.},

In addition to hindering the application of DFT to predicting electronic properties, the band gap problem is intimately related to self-interaction and delocalization errors, which make the study of charge transfer mechanisms with DFT difficult. In this work, we present two key innovations to address the band gap problem. First, we design an approach for machine learning density functionals based on Gaussian processes to explicitly fit single-particle energy levels. Second, we introduce novel nonlocal features of the density matrix that are expressive enough to fit these single-particle levels. Combining these developments, we train a machine-learned functional for the exact exchange energy that predicts molecular energy gaps and reaction energies of a wide range of molecules in excellent agreement with reference hybrid DFT calculations. In addition, while being trained solely on molecular data, our model predicts reasonable formation energies of polarons in solids, showcasing its transferability and robustness. Our approach generalizes straightforwardly to full exchange-correlation functionals, thus paving the way to the design of novel state-of-the-art functionals for the prediction of electronic properties of molecules and materials.},

Recently, the introduction of screened range-separated hybrid (SRSH) functionals for solid-state materials has allowed for the calculation of fundamental band gaps and optical absorption spectra that are in very good agreement with many-body perturbation theory. However, since solid-state SRSH functionals are typically tuned to reproduce the properties of bulk phases, their transferability to low-dimensional structures, which experience substantially different screening than in the bulk, remains an open question. In this work, we explore the transferability of SRSH functionals to several prototypical van der Waals materials, including transition-metal sulfides and selenides, indium selenide, black phosphorus, and hexagonal boron nitride. Considering the bulk and a monolayer of these materials as limiting cases, we show that the parameters of the SRSH functional can be determined systematically, using only the band-edge quasiparticle energies of these extremal structural phases as fitting targets. The resulting SRSH functionals can describe both electronic bandstructures and optical absorption spectra with accuracy comparable to more demanding ab initio many-body perturbation theory (GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation) approaches. Selected examples also demonstrate that the SRSH parameters, obtained from the bulk and monolayer reference structures, display good accuracy for bandstructures and optical spectra of bilayers, indicating a degree of transferability that is independent of the fitting procedure.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive microscopic description of thermally induced distortions in lead halide perovskites is crucial for their realistic applications, yet still unclear. Here, we quantify the effects of thermal activation in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals across length scales with atomic-level precision, and we provide a framework for the description of phase transitions therein, beyond the simplistic picture of unit-cell symmetry increase upon heating. The temperature increase significantly enhances the short-range structural distortions of the lead halide framework as a consequence of the phonon anharmonicity, which causes the excess free energy surface to change as a function of temperature. As a result, phase transitions can be rationalized via the soft-mode model, which also describes displacive thermal phase transitions in oxide perovskites. Our findings allow to reconcile temperature-dependent modifications of physical properties, such as changes in the optical band gap, that are incompatible with the perovskite time- and space-average structures.}

  abstract = {Since the end of the cold war, macroscopic amounts of separated stable isotopes of most elements have been available ``off the shelf'' at affordable prices. Using these materials, single crystals of many semiconductors have been grown and the dependence of their physical properties on isotopic composition has been investigated. The most conspicuous effects observed have to do with the dependence of phonon frequencies and linewidths on isotopic composition. These affect the electronic properties of solids through the mechanism of electron-phonon interaction, in particular, in the corresponding optical excitation spectra and energy gaps. This review contains a brief introduction to the history, availability, and characterization of stable isotopes, including their many applications in science and technology. It is followed by a concise discussion of the effects of isotopic composition on the vibrational spectra, including the influence of average isotopic masses and isotopic disorder on the phonons. The final sections deal with the effects of electron-phonon interaction on energy gaps, the concomitant effects on the luminescence spectra of free and bound excitons, with particular emphasis on silicon, and the effects of isotopic composition of the host material on the optical transitions between the bound states of hydrogenic impurities.}

We compare our GW calculations to coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] reference data for GW100. We find scGW and qsGW ionization energies in excellent agreement with CCSD(T), with discrepancies typically smaller than 0.3 eV (scGW) and 0.2 eV (qsGW), respectively. For scGW0 and G0W0 the deviation from CCSD(T) is strongly dependent on the starting point. We further relate the discrepancy between the GW ionization energies and CCSD(T) to the deviation from straight line error (DSLE). In DSLE-minimized GW calculations, the DSLE is significantly reduced, yielding a systematic improvement in the description of the ionization energies.}

  abstract = {The advent of pump-probe spectroscopy techniques paved the way to the exploration of ultrafast dynamics of electrons and phonons in crystalline solids. Following photo-absorption of a pump pulse and the initial electronic thermalization, the dynamics of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom is dominated by electron-phonon and phonon-phonon scattering processes. The two-temperature model (TTM) and its generalizations provide valuable tools to describe these phenomena and the ensuing coupled dynamics of electrons and phonons. While more sophisticated theoretical approaches are nowadays available, the conceptual and computational simplicity of the TTM makes it the method of choice to model thermalization processes in pump-probe spectroscopy, and it keeps being widely applied in both experimental and theoretical studies. In the domain of ab-initio methods, the time-dependent Boltzmann equation (TDBE) ameliorates many of the shortcomings of the TTM and enables a realistic and parameter-free description of ultrafast phenomena with full momentum resolution. After a pedagogical introduction to the TTM and TDBE, in this manuscript we review their application to the description of ultrafast process in solid-state physics and materials science as well as their theoretical foundation.},

The resulting OEP can be identified as the exchange potential of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory. The present work generalizes this OEP approach to treat the correlated case, and shows that the Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation potential is the variationally best local approximation to the exchange-correlation self-energy. This provides a variational derivation of the equation for the exact exchange-correlation potential that was derived by Sham and Schl\"uter using a density condition. Implications for an approximate physical interpretation of the Kohn-Sham orbitals are discussesd. A correlated generalization of the Sharp-Horton--Krieger-Li-Iafrate [Phys Lett.

  abstract = {The classic density-functional theory (DFT) formalism introduced by Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham in the mid-1960s, is based upon the idea that the complicated N-electron wavefunction can be replaced with the mathematically simpler 1-electron charge density in electronic struc- ture calculations of the ground stationary state. As such, ordinary DFT is neither able to treat time-dependent (TD) problems nor describe excited electronic states. In 1984, Runge and Gross proved a theorem making TD-DFT formally exact. Information about electronic excited states may be obtained from this theory through the linear response (LR) theory formalism. Begin- ning in the mid-1990s, LR-TD-DFT became increasingly popular for calculating absorption and other spectra of medium- and large-sized molecules. Its ease of use and relatively good accuracy has now brought LR-TD-DFT to the forefront for this type of application. As the number and the diversity of applications of TD-DFT has grown, so too has grown our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the approximate functionals commonly used for TD-DFT. The objective of this article is to continue where a previous review of TD-DFT in this series [Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 55: 427 (2004)] left off and highlight some of the problems and solutions from the point of view of applied physical chemistry. Since doubly-excited states have a particularly important role to play in bond dissociation and formation in both thermal and photochemistry, particular emphasis will be placed upon the problem of going beyond or around the TD-DFT adiabatic approximation which limits TD-DFT calculations to nominally singly-excited states.

Key exact results, for example, the equivalence between the infamous derivative discontinuity problem and the description of weight dependencies in the ensemble exchange-correlation density functional, are highlighted. The variational evaluation of orbital-dependent ensemble Hartree-exchange (Hx) energies is discussed in detail. We show in passing that state-averaging individual exact Hx energies can lead to severe (although solvable) v-representability issues. Finally, we explore the possibility of using the concept of density-driven correlation, which has been introduced recently and does not exist in regular ground-state DFT, for improving state-of-the-art correlation density-functional approximations for ensembles. The present review reflects the efforts of a growing community to turn ensemble DFT into a rigorous and reliable low-cost computational method for excited states.

In this work, we address a broader class of excitations, with a particular focus on double excitations. An exact implementation of the theory is presented for the two-electron Hubbard dimer model. A thorough comparison of the true physical ground- and excited-state electronic structures with that of the fictitious ensemble density-functional KS system is also presented. Depending on the choice of the density-functional ensemble as well as the asymmetry of the dimer and the correlation strength, an inversion of states can be observed. In some other cases, the strong mixture of KS states within the true physical system makes the assignment "single excitation" or "double excitation" irrelevant.},

  abstract = {We present an approximate approach for the calculation of ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) by exploiting the complementary energy non-linearity errors for a species M and its one-electron-ionized counterpart (M+). Reasonable IPs and EAs are thus obtained by averaging the orbital energies of M and M+, even with a low-level method such as BLYP/6-31G(d). By combining the corrected IPs and EAs, we can further obtain reasonable excitation energies. The errors in uncorrected valence IPs and uncorrected virtual-orbital energies show systematic trends. These characteristics provide a convenient and computationally efficient avenue for qualitative estimation of these properties with single corrections for multiple IPs and excitation energies.}

We compare our calculations with available experimental data to evaluate the accuracy of different approximations in predicting thermoelectric properties. We observe fair agreement between experiment and computation for the maximum Seebeck coefficient determined with MP band structures and the BoltzTraP code under a constant relaxation time approximation (R2 = 0.79). We additionally find that scissoring the band gap to the experimental value improves the agreement. We find that power factors calculated with a constant and universal relaxation time approximation show much poorer agreement with experiment (R2 = 0.33). We test two minimum thermal conductivity models (Clarke and Cahill--Pohl), finding that both these models reproduce measured values fairly accurately (R2 = 0.82) using parameters obtained from computation. Additionally, we analyze this data set to gain broad insights into the effects of chemistry, crystal structure, and electronic structure on thermoelectric properties. For example, our computations indicate that oxide band structures tend to produce lower power factors than those of sulfides, selenides, and tellurides, even under the same doping and relaxation time constraints. We also list families of compounds identified to possess high valley degeneracies. Finally, we present a clustering analysis of our results. We expect that these studies should help guide and assess future high-throughput computational screening studies of thermoelectric materials.},

  abstract = {\copyright{} Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society. The catalytic cycle of photosynthetic water oxidation occurs at the Mn 4 CaO 5 oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II. Extensive spectroscopic data have been collected on the intermediates, especially the S 2 (Kok) state, although the proton and electron inventories (Mn oxidation states) are still uncertain. The "high oxidation" paradigm assigns S 2 Mn oxidation level (III, IV, IV, IV) or (IV, IV, IV, III), whereas a "low oxidation" paradigm posits two additional electrons. Here, we investigate the geometric (X-ray diffraction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure) and spectroscopic (electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR)) properties of the S 2 state using quantum chemical density functional theory calculations, focusing on the neglected low paradigm. Two interconvertible electronic spin configurations are predicted as ground states, producing multiline (S = 1/2) and broad (S = 5/2) EPR signals in the low paradigm oxidation state (III, IV, III, III) and with W2 as OH - and O5 as OH - . They have "open" (S = 5/2) and "closed" (S = 1/2) Mn 3 CaO 4 -cubane geometries. Other energetically accessible isomers with ground spin states 1/2, 7/2, 9/2, or 11/2 can be obtained through perturbations of hydrogen-bonding networks (e.g., H + from His337 to O3 or W2), consistent with experimental observations. Conformers with the low oxidation state configuration (III, IV, IV, II) also become energetically accessible when the protonation states are O5 (OH - ), W2 (H 2 O), and neutral His337. The configuration with (III, IV, III, III) agrees well with earlier low-temperature EPR and ENDOR interpretations, whereas the Mn II -containing configuration agrees partially with recent ENDOR data. However, the low oxidation paradigm does not yield isotropic ligand hyperfine interactions in good agreement with observed values. We conclude that the low Mn oxidation state proposal for the OEC can closely fit most of the available structural and electronic data for S 2 at accessible energies.}

The relative energies and orbital energies are not changed appreciably by the introduction of a relativistic correction. The present result does not agree with all the spectroscopic observations, but is consistent with a magnetic moment study.},

In the second last transition (S2 to S3) cofactor oxidation is coupled to water molecule binding to Mn1. It is this activated, water-enriched all MnIV form of the cofactor that goes on to form the O-O bond, after the next light-induced oxidation to S4 How cofactor activation proceeds remains an open question. Here, we report a so far not described intermediate (S3') in which cofactor oxidation has occurred without water insertion. This intermediate can be trapped in a significant fraction of centers ({$>$}50\%) in (i) chemical-modified cofactors in which Ca2+ is exchanged with Sr2+; the Mn4O5Sr cofactor remains active, but the S2-S3 and S3-S0 transitions are slower than for the Mn4O5Ca cofactor; and (ii) upon addition of 3\% vol/vol methanol; methanol is thought to act as a substrate water analog. The S3' electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal is significantly broader than the untreated S3 signal (2.5 T vs. 1.5 T), indicating the cofactor still contains a 5-coordinate Mn ion, as seen in the preceding S2 state. Magnetic double resonance data extend these findings revealing the electronic connectivity of the S3' cofactor is similar to the high spin form of the preceding S2 state, which contains a cuboidal Mn3O4Ca unit tethered to an external, 5-coordinate Mn ion (Mn4). These results demonstrate that cofactor oxidation regulates water molecule insertion via binding to Mn4. The interaction of ammonia with the cofactor is also discussed.},

Static correlation is necessary both for the appropriate description of the metal-ligand bonding and for a correct description of the multi-determinant character arising from the magnetic interactions between spin centers. Density functional theory is usually applied using a single-determinant broken-symmetry state which is lacking the correct spin symmetry when the ground state has total low-spin character. To alleviate this drawback we use the extended broken symmetry (EBS) approach to derive approximate ground state energies and, for the first time, forces for the correctly symmetric ground state o...}

  abstract = {CsSnI3 is an unusual perovskite that undergoes complex displacive and reconstructive phase transitions and exhibits near-infrared emission at room temperature. Experimental and theoretical studies of CsSnI3 have been limited by the lack of detailed crystal structure characterization and chemical instability. Here we describe the synthesis of pure polymorphic crystals, the preparation of large crack-/bubble-free ingots, the refined single-crystal structures, and temperature-dependent charge transport and optical properties of CsSnI3, coupled with ab initio first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In situ temperature-dependent single-crystal and synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction studies reveal the origin of polymorphous phase transitions of CsSnI3. The black orthorhombic form of CsSnI3 demonstrates one of the largest volumetric thermal expansion coefficients for inorganic solids. Electrical conductivity, Hall effect, and thermopower measurements on it show p-type metallic behavior with low carrier density, despite the optical band gap of 1.3 eV. Hall effect measurements of the black orthorhombic perovskite phase of CsSnI3 indicate that it is a p-type direct band gap semiconductor with carrier concentration at room temperature of {$\sim$} 1017 cm--3 and a hole mobility of {$\sim$}585 cm2 V--1 s--1. The hole mobility is one of the highest observed among p-type semiconductors with comparable band gaps. Its powders exhibit a strong room-temperature near-IR emission spectrum at 950 nm. Remarkably, the values of the electrical conductivity and photoluminescence intensity increase with heat treatment. The DFT calculations show that the screened-exchange local density approximation-derived band gap agrees well with the experimentally measured band gap. Calculations of the formation energy of defects strongly suggest that the electrical and light emission properties possibly result from Sn defects in the crystal structure, which arise intrinsically. Thus, although stoichiometric CsSnI3 is a semiconductor, the material is prone to intrinsic defects associated with Sn vacancies. This creates highly mobile holes which cause the materials to appear metallic.}

In this work we focus on two representatives of a well known family of cathode materials for Li-ion batteries, namely the orthorhombic LiMPO\$\_4\$ olivines (M = Fe, Mn). We show that extended Hubbard functionals with on-site (\$U\$) and inter-site (\$V\$) interactions (so called DFT+U+V) can predict the relative stability of different phases and the overall average voltage of the battery with remarkable accuracy. We find, in particular, that the inclusion of inter-site interactions in the corrective Hamiltonian improves considerably the prediction of thermodynamic quantities when electronic localization occurs in presence of significant interatomic hybridization (as is the case for the Mn compound), and that the self-consistent evaluation of the effective interaction parameters as material- and ground-state-dependent quantities, allows the prediction of energy differences between different phases and concentrations.}

Formulas for the energy derivatives with respect to number of electrons are derived, which clarify the role of optimized effective potentials in prediction of the band gap. Calculations with a recent functional that has much improved behavior for fractional charges give a good prediction of the energy gap and also {$\varepsilon$}HOMO -I for finite systems.

Such fractional-spin states are shown to be ensembles of degenerate ground states with normal spins. It is proven here that the energy of the exact functional for fractional-spin states is a constant, equal to the energy of the comprising degenerate pure-spin states. Dramatic deviations from this exact constancy condition exist with all approximate functionals, leading to large static correlation errors for strongly correlated systems, such as chemical bond dissociation and band structure of Mott insulators. This is demonstrated with numerical calculations for several molecular systems. Approximating the constancy behavior for fractional spins should be a major aim in functional constructions and should open the frontier for density functional theory to describe strongly correlated systems. The key results are also shown to apply in reduced density-matrix functional theory.}

We illustrate the importance of such generalization when dealing with challenging systems containing orbitals with very different chemical character, also highlighting the simple dependence of the screening on the localization of the orbitals. We choose a set of 46 transition-metal complexes for which experimental data and accurate many-body perturbation theory calculations are available. When compared to experiment, results for ionization potentials show a very good performance, with a mean absolute error of 0.2 eV, comparable to the most accurate many-body perturbation theory approaches. These results reiterate the role of Koopmans-compliant functionals as simple and accurate quasiparticle approximations to the exact spectral functional, bypassing diagrammatic expansions and relying only on the physics of the local density or generalized-gradient approximation.}

  abstract = {In recent years, the need for a more sustainable economic development contributed to the increasing interest in renewable energy sources. With encouraging trends on power conversion efficiencies and manufacturing costs, photovoltaics is expected to be the workhorse for the production of green energy in the future. Silicon is currently the dominant photovoltaic technology but, in the past decade, novel solutions based on organic semiconductors became attractive for their potential of overcoming the Shockley-Queisser limit and offering unmatched efficiencies by exploiting singlet fission. The latter is an exciton multiplication process in which, for a certain class of materials, a singlet exciton splits into two triplet excitons, thus potentially doubling the charge carriers. Significant work is still necessary to fully benefit of singlet fission in photovoltaics; in particular, a higher degree of control over exciton transport and dissociation mechanisms at hetero-organic interfaces is required for efficiently harvesting triplet excitons. To the aim of better understanding such processes, at the ANCHOR-SUNDYN endstation of the ALOISA beamline at Elettra we developed an experimental setup for time-resolved X-ray spectroscopies, in which the exciton dynamics in organic films can be characterized by X-ray photoemission and absorption spectroscopies with a 100 ps resolution. Here, we can combine time-resolved measurements with standard X-ray and UV spectroscopies for a more detailed analysis of the samples.We apply this approach to donor/acceptor interfaces, the prototypical architectures of organic photovoltaic devices; we investigate triplet excited states in pentacene by means of time-resolved X-ray absorption, which displays a pump-induced feature with a 0.3\textpm 0.2 ns lifetime below the LUMO resonance, that we associated to molecules in the triplet state. On the picosecond time scale, measurements performed at the FLASH free-electron laser reveal a photoelectron response that we deem related to the triplet exciton dissociation at the interface with the underlying C60 film. A similar effect is also observed in pump-probe photoemission spectra of tetracene / copper phthalocyanine interfaces. On this second system, we tuned the pump wavelength to selectively excite the two materials and examined the different behavior of the photogenerated excitons; the presence of a transient field in the microsecond time scale suggests that triplet excitons are involved in the charge transfer that occurs from tetracene to copper phthalocyanine, in agreement with previous studies. The results presented here demonstrate that time-resolved X-ray spectroscopies can provide valuable information for the characterization of exciton dynamics in hetero-organic interfaces.

  abstract = {Hubbard-like Hamiltonians are widely used to describe on-site Coulomb interactions in magnetic and strongly-correlated solids, but there is much confusion in the literature about the form these Hamiltonians should take for shells of p and d orbitals. This paper derives the most general s,p, and d orbital Hubbard-like Hamiltonians consistent with the relevant symmetries, and presents them in ways convenient for practical calculations. We use the full configuration interaction method to study p and d orbital dimers and compare results obtained using the correct Hamiltonian and the collinear and vector Stoner Hamiltonians. The Stoner Hamiltonians can fail to describe properly the nature of the ground state, the time evolution of excited states, and the electronic heat capacity.}

  abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII), a multisubunit pigment-protein supercomplex found in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants, catalyzes a unique reaction in nature: the light-driven oxidation of water. Remarkable recent advances in the structural analysis of PSII now give a detailed picture of the static supercomplex on the molecular level. These data provide a solid foundation for future functional studies, in particular the mechanism of water oxidation and oxygen release. The catalytic core of the PSII is a tetramanganese-calcium cluster (Mn{$_4$}O{$_5$}Ca), commonly referred to as the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The function of the OEC rests on its ability to cycle through five metastable states (Si, i = 0-4), transiently storing four oxidizing equivalents, and in so doing, facilitates the four electron water splitting reaction. While the latest crystallographic model of PSII gives an atomic picture of the OEC, the exact connectivity within the inorganic core and the S-state(s) that the X-ray model represents remain uncertain. In this Account, we describe our joint experimental and theoretical efforts to eliminate these ambiguities by combining the X-ray data with spectroscopic constraints and introducing computational modeling. We are developing quantum chemical methods to predict electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) parameters for transition metal clusters, especially focusing on spin-projection approaches combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We aim to resolve the geometric and electronic structures of all S-states, correlating their structural features with spectroscopic observations to elucidate reactivity. The sequence of manganese oxidations and concomitant charge compensation events via proton transfer allow us to rationalize the multielectron S-state cycle. EPR spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations provides a unique window into the tetramangenese complex, in particular its protonation states and metal ligand sphere evolution, far beyond the scope of static techniques such as X-ray crystallography. This approach has led, for example, to a detailed understanding of the EPR signals in the S{$_2$}-state of the OEC in terms of two interconvertible, isoenergetic structures. These two structures differ in their valence distribution and spin multiplicity, which has important consequences for substrate binding and may explain its low barrier exchange with solvent water. New experimental techniques and innovative sample preparations are beginning to unravel the complex sequence of substrate uptake/inclusion, which is coupled to proton release. The introduction of specific site perturbations, such as replacing Ca{$^{2+}$} with Sr{$^{2+}$}, provides discrete information about the ligand environment of the individual Mn ions. In this way, we have identified a potential open coordination site for one Mn center, which may serve as a substrate binding site in the higher S-states, such as S{$_3$} and S{$_4$}. In addition, we can now monitor the binding of the substrate water in the lower S-states (S{$_1$} and S{$_2$}) using new EPR-detected NMR spectroscopies. These studies provided the first evidence that one of the substrates is subsumed into the complex itself and forms an oxo-bridge between two Mn ions. This result places important new restrictions on the mechanism of O-O bond formation. These new insights from nature's water splitting catalyst provide important criteria for the rational design of bioinspired synthetic catalysts.},

In the context of a global artificial photosynthesis (GAP) project, we review our current work on nature's water splitting catalyst. In a recent report (Cox et al. 2014 Science 345, 804--808 (doi:10.1126/science.1254910)), we showed that the catalyst---a Mn 4 O 5 Ca cofactor---converts into an 'activated' form immediately prior to the O--O bond formation step. This activated state, which represents an all Mn IV complex, is similar to the structure observed by X-ray crystallogra-phy but requires the coordination of an additional water molecule. Such a structure locates two oxygens, both derived from water, in close proximity, which probably come together to form the product O 2 molecule. We speculate that formation of the activated catalyst state requires inherent structural flexi-bility. These features represent new design criteria for the development of biomimetic and bioinspired model systems for water splitting catalysts using first-row transition metals with the aim of delivering globally deployable artificial photosynthesis technologies.},

Freely dissolved in the hemolymph, they are multi-subunit proteins that contain many copies of the active site, a copper atom pair that reversibly binds oxygen. Octopus hemocyanin is composed of ten subunits, each of which contain seven oxygen-binding ``functional units''. The carboxyl-terminal 47 kDa functional unit, Odg, is a proteolytic isolate that binds oxygen reversibly while exhibiting slight Bohr and magnesium ion effects. In this work we present the X-ray structure determination and analysis of Odg at 2.3 \AA{} resolution. Odg has two structural domains: a largely {$\alpha$}-helical copper binding domain, and a five-stranded anti-parallel {$\beta$}-sandwich with the jelly roll topology found in many viruses. Six histidine residues ligate the copper atoms, one of which is involved in a thioether bridge. The results show that the hemocyanin from the mollusc and that from the arthropod have distinct tertiary folds in addition to the long recognized differences in their quaternary structures. Nonetheless, a comparison of Octopus and horseshoe crab hemocyanin reveals a similar active site, in a striking example of perhaps both convergent and divergent evolution.}

  abstract = {Virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS) and machine learning (ML) with density functional theory (DFT) suffer from inaccuracies from the underlying density functional approximation (DFA). Many of these inaccuracies can be traced to the lack of derivative discontinuity that leads to a curvature in the energy with electron addition or removal. Over a dataset of nearly one thousand transition metal complexes typical of VHTS applications, we computed and analyzed the average curvature (i.e., deviation from piecewise linearity) for 23 density functional approximations spanning multiple rungs of 'Jacob's ladder'. While we observe the expected dependence of the curvatures on HF exchange, we note limited correlation of curvature values between different rungs of 'Jacob's ladder'. We train ML models (i.e., artificial neural networks or ANNs) to predict the curvature and the associated frontier orbital energies for each of these 23 functionals and then interpret differences in curvature among the different DFAs through analysis of the ML models. Notably, we observe spin to play a much more important role in determining the curvature of range-separated and double hybrids in comparison to semi-local functionals, explaining why curvature values are weakly correlated between these and other families of functionals. Over a space of 187.2k hypothetical compounds, we use our ANNs to pinpoint DFAs for which representative transition metal complexes have near-zero curvature with low uncertainty, demonstrating an approach to accelerate screening of complexes with targeted optical gaps.},

These technological advances and the improved sample quality have enabled ARPES to emerge as a leading tool in the investigation of the high-Tc superconductors. This paper reviews the most recent ARPES results on the cuprate superconductors and their insulating parent and sister compounds, with the purpose of providing an updated summary of the extensive literature. The low-energy excitations are discussed with emphasis on some of the most relevant issues, such as the Fermi surface and remnant Fermi surface, the superconducting gap, the pseudogap and d-wave-like dispersion, evidence of electronic inhomogeneity and nanoscale phase separation, the emergence of coherent quasiparticles through the superconducting transition, and many-body effects in the one-particle spectral function due to the interaction of the charge with magnetic and/or lattice degrees of freedom. Given the dynamic nature of the field, we chose to focus mainly on reviewing the experimental data, as on the experimental side a general consensus has been reached, whereas interpretations and related theoretical models can vary significantly. The first part of the paper introduces photoemission spectroscopy in the context of strongly interacting systems, along with an update on the state-of-the-art instrumentation. The second part provides an overview of the scientific issues relevant to the investigation of the low-energy electronic structure by ARPES. The rest of the paper is devoted to the experimental results from the cuprates, and the discussion is organized along conceptual lines: normal-state electronic structure, interlayer interaction, superconducting gap, coherent superconducting peak, pseudogap, electron self-energy, and collective modes. Within each topic, ARPES data from the various copper oxides are presented.}

This is of vital importance in elucidating the connection between electronic, magnetic, and chemical structure of solids, in particular for those complex systems which cannot be appropriately described within the independent-particle picture. The last decade witnessed significant progress in this technique and its applications, thus ushering in a new era in photoelectron spectroscopy; today, ARPES experiments with 2 meV energy resolution and 0.28 angular resolution are a reality even for photoemission on solids. In this paper we will review the fundamentals of the technique and present some illustrative experimental results; we will show how ARPES can probe the momentum-dependent electronic structure of solids providing detailed information on band dispersion and Fermi surface as well as on the strength and nature of many-body correlations, which may profoundly affect the oneelectron excitation spectrum and in turn the macroscopic physical properties.},

  abstract = {Obtaining a precise theoretical description of the spectral properties of liquid water poses challenges for both molecular dynamics (MD) and electronic structure methods. The lower computational cost of the Koopmans-compliant functionals with respect to Green's function methods allows the simulations of many MD trajectories, with a description close to the state-of-art quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections method (QSGW + fxc). Thus, we explore water spectral properties when different MD approaches are used, ranging from classical MD to first-principles MD, and including nuclear quantum effects. We have observed that different MD approaches lead to up to 1 eV change in the average band gap; thus, we focused on the band gap dependence with the geometrical properties of a system to explain such spread. We have evaluated the changes in the band gap due to variations in the intramolecular O--H bond distance and HOH angle, as well as the intermolecular hydrogen bond O{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}O distance and the OHO angles. We have observed that the dominant contribution comes from the O--H bond length; the O{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}O distance plays a secondary role, and the other geometrical properties do not significantly influence the gap. Furthermore, we analyze the electronic density of states (DOS), where the KIPZ functional shows good agreement with the DOS obtained with state-of-art approaches employing quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections. The O--H bond length also significantly influences the DOS. When nuclear quantum effects are considered, broadening of the peaks driven by the broader distribution of the O--H bond lengths is observed, leading to a closer agreement with the experimental photoemission spectra.}

  abstract = {The light-driven oxidation of water in photosystem II (PSII) produces nearly all of the molecular oxygen on Earth and drives the production of nearly all of Earth's biomass. Determining the mechanism of O 2 formation in PSII is one of the hottest topics in photosynthesis and has stimulated much interest in the development of artificial photosynthesis. The catalytic water-oxidizing center (WOC) consists of a Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster, nearby amino acid residues, and numerous surrounding water molecules (Fig. 1). Rapid progress in understanding the mechanism of O 2 formation has been made in the last 5 years because of developments in crystallography (e.g., the development of free electron laser sources) and the interplay between new structural information, com-putational studies, and advanced biophysical methods such as pulsed EPR spectroscopy, X-ray absorbance spectroscopy, and membrane inlet mass spectrometry (1--4). FTIR spectroscopy is an additional biophysical method that has the advantage of being sensitive to the amino acid residues and water molecules that sur-round the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster. However, the interpretation of much of the FTIR literature on PSII has been hampered by an inability to assign spectral features to specific resi-dues or functional groups. In PNAS, Nakamura and Noguchi (5) address this problem by simulating FTIR difference spectra of the WOC in the symmetric car-boxylate stretching region on the basis of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods. PSII is located in the thylakoid membranes of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. It is a homodimer in vivo, having a total molecular weight of {$\sim$}700 kDa with each monomer containing at least 20 different subunits and nearly 60 organic and inorganic cofactors. The largest membrane-spanning subunits include CP47 (56 kDa), CP43 (52 kDa), D2 (39 kDa), and D1 (38 kDa). The Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster is ligated by six carboxylate groups, one histidine side chain, and four water molecules. The histi-dine residue (H332) and five of the six carboxylate groups (D170, E189, E333, D342, and the C terminus at A344) are from D1, and one (E354) is from CP43. Recent 1.9-and 1.95-\AA{} crystallographic structures of PSII show that the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster is arranged as a distorted Mn 3 CaO 4 cube that is linked to a fourth " dangling " Mn ion (denoted Mn4) by two oxo bridges (6, 7). Two water molecules (W1 and W2) coordinate to Mn4, and two (W3 and W4) coordinate to the Ca 2+ ion. Networks of hydrogen bonds in the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster's envi-ronment efficiently transport protons away from the cluster and permit the access of water. Light-induced separations of charge within PSII drive the accumulation of oxidizing equivalents on the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster. During each catalytic cycle, the cluster accumulates four oxidiz-ing equivalents, cycling through five oxidation states termed S n , where " n " denotes the number of oxidizing Fig. 1.

  abstract = {Physical properties of multi-orbital materials depend not only on the strength of the effective interactions among the valence electrons but also on their type. Strong correlations are caused by either Mott physics that captures the Coulomb repulsion among charges, or Hund physics that aligns the spins in different orbitals. We identify four energy scales marking the onset and the completion of screening in orbital and spin channels. The differences in these scales, which are manifest in the temperature dependence of the local spectrum and of the charge, spin and orbital susceptibilities, provide clear signatures distinguishing Mott and Hund physics. We illustrate these concepts with realistic studies of two archetypal strongly correlated materials, and corroborate the generality of our conclusions with a model Hamiltonian study.}

The MLWF-TB Hamiltonian used in WanTiBEXOS package can be obtained via any density functional theory package interfaced with Wannier90 code. It's expected, due MLWF-TB formalism, a computational time reduction around one or more orders of magnitude in comparison with BSE ab initio implementations. In order to demonstrate its reliability, flexibility, efficiency and versatility of WanTiBEXOS, we simulate electronic and optical property calculations for the representative materials, including conventional bulk semiconductors, perovskites, nano-monolayer materials and van der Waals heterostructures.

  abstract = {The general theory of quantum mechanics is now almost complete, the imperfections that still remain being in connection with the exact fitting in of the theory with relativity ideas. These give rise to difficulties only when high-speed particles are involved, and are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions, in which it is, indeed, usually sufficiently accurate if one neglects relativity variation of mass with velocity and assumes only Coulomb forces between the various electrons and atomic nuclei. The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It there fore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation. Already before the arrival of quantum mechanics there existed a theory of atomic structure, based on Bohr's ideas of quantised orbits, which was fairly successful in a wide field. To get agreement with experiment it was found necessary to introduce the spin of the electron, giving a doubling in the number of orbits of an electron in an atom. With the help of this spin and Pauli's exclusion principle, a satisfactory theory of multiplet terms was obtained when one made the additional assumption that the electrons in an atom all set themselves with their spins parallel or antiparallel. If s denoted the magnitude of the resultant spin angular momentum, this s was combined vectorially with the resultant orbital angular momentum l to give a multiplet of multiplicity 2 s + 1. The fact that one had to make this additional assumption was, however, a serious disadvantage, as no theoretical reasons to support it could be given. It seemed to show that there were large forces coupling the spin vectors of the electrons in an atom, much larger forces than could be accounted for as due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the electrons. The position was thus that there was empirical evidence in favour of these large forces, but that their theoretical nature was quite unknown.}

Solving the Bethe--Salpeter equation (BSE) for electron--hole pairs usually yields accurate predictions of absorption spectra, but it is computationally expensive, especially if thermal averages of spectra computed for multiple configurations are required. We present a method based on machine learning to evaluate a key quantity entering the definition of absorption spectra: the dielectric screening. We show that our approach yields a model for the screening that is transferable between multiple configurations sampled during first principles molecular dynamics simulations; hence it leads to a substantial improvement in the efficiency of calculations of finite temperature spectra. We obtained computational gains of one to two orders of magnitude for systems with 50 to 500 atoms, including liquids, solids, nanostructures, and solid/liquid interfaces. Importantly, the models of dielectric screening derived here may be used not only in the solution of the BSE but also in developing functionals for time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Overall, our work provides a strategy to combine machine learning with electronic structure calculations to accelerate first principles simulations of excited-state properties.},

  abstract = {We present an implementation of the \$GW\$ space-time approach that allows cubic-scaling all-electron calculations with standard Gaussian basis sets without exploiting any localization nor sparsity considerations. The independent-electron susceptibility is constructed in a time representation over a non-uniform distribution of real-space locations \$\textbackslash lbrace \{\textbackslash bf r\}\_k \textbackslash rbrace\$ optimized within a separable resolution-of-the-identity framework to reproduce standard Coulomb-fitting calculations with meV accuracy. The compactness of the obtained \$\textbackslash lbrace \{\textbackslash bf r\}\_k \textbackslash rbrace\$ distribution leads to a crossover with the standard Coulomb-fitting scheme for system sizes below a few hundred electrons. The needed analytic continuation follows a recent approach that requires the continuation of the screened Coulomb potential rather than the much more structured self-energy. The present scheme is benchmarked over large molecular sets and scaling properties are demonstrated on a family of defected hexagonal boron-nitride flakes containing up to 6000 electrons.},

  abstract = {To explore the formation of noncollinear magnetic configurations in materials with strongly correlated electrons, we derive a noncollinear LSDA+U model involving only one parameter U, as opposed to the difference between the Hubbard and Stoner parameters U-J. Computing U in the constrained random phase approximation, we investigate noncollinear magnetism of uranium dioxide UO2 and find that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) stabilizes the 3k ordered magnetic ground state. The estimated SOC strength in UO2 is as large as 0.73 eV per uranium atom, making spin and orbital degrees of freedom virtually inseparable. Using a multipolar pseudospin Hamiltonian, we show how octupolar and dipole-dipole exchange coupling help establish the 3k magnetic ground state with canted ordering of uranium f orbitals. The cooperative Jahn-Teller effect does not appear to play a significant part in stabilizing the noncollinear 3k state, which has the lowest energy even in an undistorted lattice. The choice of parameter U in the LSDA+U model has a notable quantitative effect on the predicted properties of UO2, in particular on the magnetic exchange interaction and, perhaps trivially, on the band gap: The value of U=3.46eV computed fully ab initio delivers the band gap of 2.11 eV in good agreement with experiment, and a balanced account of other pertinent energy scales.}

This is in contrast to its original version and many other traditional wave-function-based all-electron band structure methods dealing with periodically ordered solids. Direct access to the GF results in several appealing features. In addition, a wide applicability of the method is achieved by employing multiple scattering theory. The basic ideas behind the resulting KKR-GF method are outlined and the different techniques to deal with the underlying multiple scattering problem are reviewed. Furthermore, various applications of the KKR-GF method are reviewed in some detail to demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of the approach. Special attention is devoted to the numerous developments of the KKR-GF method, that have been contributed in recent years by a number of work groups, in particular in the following fields: embedding schemes for atoms, clusters and surfaces, magnetic response functions and anisotropy, electronic and spin-dependent transport, dynamical mean field theory, various kinds of spectroscopies, as well as first-principles determination of model parameters.},

  abstract = {The Bethe--Salpeter equation (BSE) can be applied to compute from first-principles optical spectra that include the effects of screened electron--hole interactions. As input, BSE calculations require single-particle states, quasiparticle energy levels, and the screened Coulomb interaction, which are typically obtained with many-body perturbation theory, whose cost limits the scope of possible applications. This work tries to address this practical limitation, instead deriving spectral energies from Koopmans-compliant functionals and introducing a new methodology for handling the screened Coulomb interaction. The explicit calculation of the W matrix is bypassed via a direct minimization scheme applied on top of a maximally localized Wannier function basis. We validate and benchmark this approach by computing the low-lying excited states of the molecules in Thiel's set and the optical absorption spectrum of a C60 fullerene. The results show the same trends as quantum chemical methods and are in excellent agreement with previous simulations carried out at the time-dependent density functional theory or G0W0-BSE level. Conveniently, the new framework reduces the parameter space controlling the accuracy of the calculation, thereby simplifying the simulation of charge-neutral excitations, offering the potential to expand the applicability of first-principles spectroscopies to larger systems of applied interest.}

One ab initio method for solving the Schr\"odinger equation that scales favorably for large systems is variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). The recently introduced deep QMC approach uses ansatzes represented by deep neural networks and generates nearly exact ground-state solutions for molecules containing up to a few dozen electrons, with the potential to scale to much larger systems where other highly accurate methods are not feasible. In this paper, we extend one such ansatz (PauliNet) to compute electronic excited states. We demonstrate our method on various small atoms and molecules and consistently achieve high accuracy for low-lying states. To highlight the method's potential, we compute the first excited state of the much larger benzene molecule, as well as the conical intersection of ethylene, with PauliNet matching results of more expensive high-level methods.},

Related to the lack of derivative discontinuity in approximate exchange-correlation potentials, the information about the curvature has been successfully used to restore the physical meaning of Kohn-Sham orbital eigenvalues and to develop non-empirical tuning and correction schemes for density functional approximations. In this work, we propose the construction of a machine-learning framework targeting the average energy curvature between the neutral and the radical cation state of thousands of small organic molecules (QM7 database). The applicability of the model is demonstrated in the context of system-specific gamma-tuning of the LC-\$\textbackslash omega\$PBE functional and validated against the molecular first ionization potentials at equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster references. In addition, we propose a local version of the non-linear regression model and demonstrate its transferability and predictive power by determining the optimal range-separation parameter for two large molecules relevant to the field of hole-transporting materials. Finally, we explore the underlying structure of the QM7 database with the t-SNE dimensionality-reduction algorithm and identify structural and compositional patterns that promote the deviation from the piecewise linearity condition.},

We find an analytic expression for both the one-body and the many-body self-interaction energies, and quantitatively connect the two expressions through the dielectric constant. The two forms of self-interaction are found to coincide in the absence of electron screening. This analysis confers superiority to the notion of many-body self-interaction over the notion of one-body self-interaction. Next, we develop a semilocal density functional scheme that addresses the many-body self-interaction of polarons, thereby overcoming the limitations of standard density functional theory. Polaron localization is achieved through the addition of a weak local potential in the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian that enforces the piece-wise linearity of the total energy upon partial electron occupation. Our method equivalently applies to electron and hole polarons and does not require any constraint on the wave functions during the self-consistent optimization. The implementation of this scheme does not produce any computational overhead compared to standard semilocal calculations and achieves fast convergence. This approach results in polaron properties, including the atomic geometry, the electron density, and the formation energy, which are close to those achieved with a hybrid functional that similarly satisfies the piece-wise linearity condition. This suggests that addressing the many-body self-interaction results in a polaron description that is robust with respect to the functional adopted. We illustrate our approach through applications to the electron polaron in BiVO4, the hole polaron in MgO, and the hole trapped at the Al impurity in {$\alpha-$}SiO2.}

In this work, we have applied the restricted open-shell Kohn--Sham (ROKS) method for first principles molecular dynamics of dense hydrogen after thermal excitation to the first singlet excited state. The Wannier localization method has allowed us to analyze the exciton dynamics in this system. The model shows that a key mechanism of the transition is associated with the dissociation of electron-hole pairs, which allows explaining several stages of the transition of fluid H2 from molecular state to plasma. This mechanism is able to give a quantitative description of several experimental results as well as to resolve the discrepancies between experimental studies.},

  abstract = {The structure of human deoxyhaemoglobin has been refined by fitting atomic co-ordinates to a multiple-isomorphous replacement electron-density map of 2{$\cdot$}5 \AA{} resolution (Ten Eyck \& Arnone, 1975); an R-factor of 28{$\cdot$}8\% was obtained. A subsequent single cycle of Fourier refinement reduced the R-factor to 27{$\cdot$}6\%. The root-mean-square error in atomic positions, estimated by two independent methods, is 0{$\cdot$}40 \AA{} for all atoms. The estimated positional error for all alpha carbons is 0{$\cdot$}30 \AA, for alpha carbons of internal segments it is 0{$\cdot$}23 \AA, and for the iron it is 0{$\cdot$}10 \AA. The distance of the iron atom from the porphyrin plane is 0{$\cdot$}60 \AA{} in the {$\alpha$} haem and 0{$\cdot$}63 \AA{} in the {$\beta$} haem; the distance of the N({$\varepsilon$}) of the iron-linked histidine from the porphyrin plane is 2{$\cdot$}6 \AA{} in the {$\alpha$} haem and 2{$\cdot$}8 \AA{} in the {$\beta$} haem. These distances assume a planar porphyrin; the resolution is insufficient to distinguish between a planar conformation and a domed one, with a lesser displacement of the iron from the plane of the porphyrin nitrogens. The distance of C({$\gamma$}) of ValE11 from the ligand site is 3{$\cdot$}4 \AA{} in the {$\alpha$} haem and 1{$\cdot$}8 \AA{} in the {$\beta$} haem, so that the ligand site in the {$\beta$} haem is blocked. A probable salt bridge between Arg FG4(92){$\alpha$}1 and Glu CD2(43){$\beta$}2 is found in the present structure; as this salt bridge cannot be formed in haemoglobin Chesapeake (Arg FG4{$\alpha\rightarrow$}Leu) it may account for the higher oxygen affinity of the mutant (Gibson \& Nagel, 1974) through its effect on the equilibrium between the oxy and deoxy quaternary structures. Comparison of the structures of human and horse deoxyhaemoglobin indicates that significant differences occur only in the region of the amino terminus and the A helix of the {$\beta$} chain: the positions of the centres of mass of the A helices differ by 1{$\cdot$}3 \AA{} and those of the amino terminal valine residue by 4 to 5 \AA{} in the two structures, the separation between the A and E helices being greater in human than in horse deoxyhaemoglobin.}

Some of these faults can be traced back to the presence of the spurious self-interaction in the density functional. Since the application of a fully self-consistent self-interaction correction is highly demanding even for moderately large systems, we pursue a strategy of approximating the self-interaction-corrected potential with a nonlocal, pseudopotentiallike projector, first generated within the isolated atom and then updated during the self-consistent cycle in the crystal. This scheme, whose implementation is totally uncomplicated and particularly suited for the pseudopotental formalism, dramatically improves the LSDA results for a variety of compounds with a minimal increase of computing cost. \copyright{} 2003 The American Physical Society.}

Both methods lead to thoroughly different results for the relative energy of both isomers. The CASPT2 results reveal an intrinsic stabilization of the [Cu2({$\mu$}-O)2]2+ isomer, thus indicating that the presence of a [Cu2({$\mu$}-{$\eta$}2:{$\eta$}2-O2)]2+ core in the respiratory proteins must be brought back to the presence of bulky capping ligands and/or to external effects caused by solvents and counterions. Both isomers are found to be diamagnetic. For the [Cu2({$\mu$}-{$\eta$}2:{$\eta$}2-O2)]2+ isomer an antiferromagnetic coupling constant, -2J, of 4209 cm-1 is calculated at the CASPT2 level.

The implementation includes ultrasoft pseudopotentials and is valid for both insulating and metallic systems. It aims at fully exploiting the versatility of DFPT combined with the low-cost DFT+U functional. This allows us to avoid computationally intensive frozen-phonon calculations when DFT+U is used to eliminate the residual electronic self-interaction from approximate functionals and to capture the localization of valence electrons, e.g., on d or f states. In this way, the effects of electronic localization (possibly due to correlations) are consistently taken into account in the calculation of specific phonon modes, Born effective charges, dielectric tensors, and in quantities requiring well converged sums over many phonon frequencies, as phonon density of states and free energies. The new computational tool is applied to two representative systems, namely CoO, a prototypical transition metal monoxide and LiCoO2, a material employed for the cathode of Li-ion batteries. The results show the effectiveness of our formalism to capture in a quantitatively reliable way the vibrational properties of systems with localized valence electrons.}

Much of this work focuses on the interactions of excitons with the femto-to-picosecond dynamical fluctuations of their environment. However, in experiments these effects can be masked by static disorder of the excited-state energies across ensembles, whose microscopic origins are challenging to predict. Here the excited-state properties of {$\sim$}2000 atom clusters of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex are simulated using a unique combination of linear-scaling density functional theory and constrained geometric dynamics. While slow, large amplitude protein motion leads to large variations in the Qy transitions of two pigments, we identify pigment--protein correlations that greatly reduce variations in the energy gap across the ensemble, which is consistent with experimental observations of suppressed inhomogeneous dephasing of quantum beats.}

These stochastic wave-function-based approaches provide a very direct treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as benchmarks against which other techniques may be compared. They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision. The authors provide a pedagogical overview of the techniques and describe a selection of applications to ground and excited states of solids and clusters.}

These limitations can be overcome with first principles calculations with methods such as density functional theory (DFT) but at a much higher computational cost. The use of electrostatic embedding can significantly reduce this cost by representing a portion of the simulated system in terms of highly localised charge distributions. These classical charge distributions are electrostatically coupled with the quantum system and represent the effect of the environment in which the quantum system is embedded.

We compare G0W0 quasiparticle band structures calculated upon local-density approximation (LDA), screened-exchange, HSE03, PBE0, and Hartree-Fock functionals for exchange and correlation (XC) for Si, InN, and ZnO. Furthermore, the HSE03 functional is studied and compared to the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for 15 nonmetallic materials for its use as a starting point in the calculation of quasiparticle excitation energies. For this case, the effects of self-consistency in the GW self-energy are also analyzed. It is shown that the use of a gKS scheme as a starting point for a perturbative quasiparticle correction can improve upon the deficiencies found for LDA or GGA starting points for compounds with shallow d bands. For these solids, the order of the valence and conduction bands is often inverted using local or semilocal approximations for XC, which makes perturbative G0W0 calculations unreliable. The use of a gKS starting point allows for the calculation of fairly accurate band gaps even in these difficult cases, and generally single-shot G0W0 calculations following calculations using the HSE03 functional are very close to experiment.}

Although molluscan hemocyanins are currently applied as immunotherapeutic agents, their precise structure has not been determined because of their enormous size. Here, we have determined the first X-ray crystal structure of intact molluscan hemocyanin. The structure unveiled the architecture of the 3.8-MDa supermolecule composed of homologous functional units (FUs), wherein the dimers of FUs hierarchically associated to form the entire cylindrical decamer. Most of the specific inter-FU interactions were localized at narrow regions in the FU dimers, suggesting that rigid FU dimers formed by specific interactions assemble with flexibility. Furthermore, the roles of carbohydrates in assembly and allosteric effect, and conserved sulfur-containing residues in copper incorporation, were revealed. The precise structural information obtained in this study will accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of hemocyanin and its future applications.}

For SixGe1-x, more than 50\% of the heat is carried at room temperature by phonons of mean free path greater than 1 {$\mu$}m, and an addition of as little as 12\% Ge is sufficient to reduce the thermal conductivity to the minimum value achievable through alloying. Intriguingly, mass disorder is found to increase the anharmonic scattering of phonons through a modification of their vibration eigenmodes, resulting in an increase of 15\% in thermal resistivity.}

  abstract = {Hybrid functionals have proven to be of immense practical value in density-functional-theory calculations. While they are often thought to be a heuristic construct, it has been established that this is in fact not the case. Here, we present a rigorous and formally exact analysis of generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) density-functional theory of hybrid functionals, in which exact remainder exchange-correlation potentials combine with a fraction of Fock exchange to produce the correct ground-state density. First, we extend formal GKS theory by proving a generalized adiabatic connection theorem. We then use this extension to derive two different definitions for a rigorous distinction between multiplicative exchange and correlation components---one new and one previously postulated. We examine their density-scaling behavior and discuss their similarities and differences. We then present a new algorithm for obtaining exact GKS potentials by inversion of accurate reference electron densities and employ this algorithm to obtain exact potentials for simple atoms and ions. We establish that an equivalent description of the many-electron problem is indeed obtained with any arbitrary global fraction of Fock exchange, and we rationalize the Fock-fraction dependence of the computed remainder exchange-correlation potentials in terms of the new formal theory. Finally, we use the exact theoretical framework and numerical results to shed light on the exchange-correlation potential used in approximate hybrid functional calculations and to assess the consequences of different choices of fractional exchange.}

  abstract = {Hemocyanins are blue copper-containing respiratory proteins in the hemolymph of many arthropods and molluscs. Molluscan hemocyanins are decamers, didecamers, or multidecamers of a 340- to 400-kDa polypeptide subunit containing seven or eight globular functional units (FUs; FU-a to FU-h), each with an oxygen-binding site. The decamers are short 35-nm hollow cylinders, with their lumen narrowed by a collar complex. Our recently published 9-\AA{} cryo-electron microscopy/crystal structure hybrid model of a 3.4-MDa cephalopod hemocyanin decamer [Nautilus pompilius hemocyanin (NpH)] revealed the pathway of the seven-FU subunit (340 kDa), 15 types of inter-FU interface, and an asymmetric collar consisting of five ``arcs'' (FU-g pairs). We now present a comparable hybrid model of an 8-MDa gastropod hemocyanin didecamer assembled from two asymmetric decamers [isoform keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) 1 of the established immunogen KLH]. Compared to NpH, the KLH1 subunit (400 kDa) is C-terminally elongated by FU-h, which is further extended by a unique tail domain. We have found that the wall-and-arc structure of the KLH1 decamer is very similar to that of NpH. We have traced the subunit pathway and how it continues from KLH1-g to KLH1-h to form an annulus of five ``slabs'' (FU-h pairs) at one cylinder edge. The 15 types of inter-FU interface detected in NpH are also present in KLH1. Moreover, we have identified one arc/slab interface, two slab/slab interfaces, five slab/wall interfaces, and four decamer/decamer interfaces. The 27 interfaces are described on the basis of two subunit conformers, yielding an asymmetric homodimer. Six protrusions from the cryo-electron microscopy structure per subunit are associated with putative attachment sites for N-linked glycans, indicating a total of 120 sugar trees in KLH1. Also, putative binding sites for divalent cations have been detected. In conclusion, the present 9-\AA{} data on KLH1 confirm and substantially broaden our recent analysis of the smaller cephalopod hemocyanin and essentially solve the gastropod hemocyanin structure.}

This property was common to all the hemocyanins studied (Molluscan and Crustacean hemocyanins). Any possibility that this catalytic property could be due to a catalase incidentally present in the blood or linked to the hemocyanin molecule must be excluded. Not only was iron never found in the protein preparations, but the study of the activity showed several striking differences from that of catalase, among them the pH-activity curve and the action of substrate concentration. Whereas a high concentration of H2O2 inhibits Fe porphyrin catalase activity, it had no effect at all on the catalase activity of hemocyanin. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by hemocyanin is due to the presence of copper. Removal of the metal from the protein brings loss of activity. The activity is restored to the same level when hemocyanin is reconstituted. Hemocyanin from different sources does not have the same activity as calculated per unit of copper. Hemocyanin from Helix, e.g., with a molecular weight of 8,000,000 and a copper content of 0.25\textbackslash\%, had activity toward H2O2 2.5 times less than that of Octopus hemocyanin which has a molecular weight of 2,800,000 and the same copper content. Moreover, equivalent amounts of inorganic copper had no effect upon H2O2 as demonstrated manometrically.}

  abstract = {The system of two interacting electrons in one-dimensional harmonic potential or Hooke's atom is considered, again. On one hand, it appears as a model for quantum dots in a strong confinement regime, and on the other hand, it provides us with a hard test bench for new methods with the ``space splitting'' arising from the one-dimensional Coulomb potential. Here, we complete the numerous previous studies of the ground state of Hooke's atom by including the excited states and dynamics, not considered earlier. With the perturbation theory, we reach essentially exact eigenstate energies and wave functions for the strong confinement regime as novel results. We also consider external perturbation induced quantum dynamics in a simple separable case. Finally, we test our novel numerical approach based on real-time path integrals (RTPIs) in reproducing the above. The RTPI turns out to be a straightforward approach with exact account of electronic correlations for solving the eigenstates and dynamics without the conventional restrictions of electronic structure methods.}

  abstract = {In photosystem II (PSII), photosynthetic water oxidation occurs at the tetramanganese-calcium cluster that cycles through light-induced intermediates (S0 - S4) to produce oxygen from two substrate waters. The surrounding hydrogen-bonded amino-acid residues and waters form channels that facilitate proton transfer and substrate water delivery, thereby ensuring efficient water oxidation. The residue D1-S169 lies in the ``narrow'' channel and forms hydrogen bonds with the Mn4CaO5 cluster via waters W1 and Wx. To probe the role of the narrow channel in substrate-water binding, we studied the D1-S169A mutation. PSII core-complexes isolated from mutant cells exhibit inefficient S-state cycling and delayed oxygen evolution. The S2 state multiline EPR spectrum of D1-S169A PSII core-complexes differed significantly from that of wild-type and FTIR difference spectra showed that the mutation strongly perturbs the extensive network of hydrogen bonds that extends at least from D1-Y161 (YZ) to D1-D61.

As an application, we calculate complete phonon dispersions for the elemental semiconductors Si and Ge, and for the III-V semiconductor compounds GaAs, AlAs, GaSb, and AlSb. Our results are in excellent agreement with experiments where available, and provide predictions where they are not. As a byproduct, we obtain real-space interatomic force constants for these materials, which are useful both for interpolating the dynamical matrices through the Brillouin zone, and as ingredients of approximate calculations for mixed systems such as alloys and microstructures. The possibility of studying these systems using the force constants of the pure materials relies on the so-called mass approximation, B i.e., on neglecting the dependence of the force constants upon composition. The accuracy of such an approximation is tested and found to be very good for cationic intermixing in binary semiconductors, while it is less so for anionic substitutions. The situation is intermediate in the case of elemental semiconductors.}

  abstract = {A major challenge for density functional theory (DFT) is its failure to treat static correlation, yielding errors in predicted charges, band gaps, van der Waals forces, and reaction barriers. Here we combine one- and two-electron reduced density matrix (1- and 2-RDM) theories with DFT to obtain a universal O(N3) generalization of DFT for static correlation. Using the lowest unitary invariant of the cumulant 2-RDM, we generate a 1-RDM functional theory that corrects the convexity of any DFT functional to capture static correlation in its fractional orbital occupations. Importantly, the unitary invariant yields a predictive theory by revealing the dependence of the correction's strength upon the trace of the two-electron repulsion matrix. We apply the theory to the barrier to rotation in ethylene, the relative energies of the benzynes, as well as an 11-molecule, dissociation benchmark. By inheriting the computational efficiency of DFT without sacrificing the treatment of static correlation, the theory opens new possibilities for the prediction and interpretation of significant quantum molecular effects and phenomena.}

While the electron-phonon interaction has been studied for almost a century, predictive nonempirical calculations have become feasible only during the past two decades. Today it is possible to calculate from first principles many materials properties related to the electron-phonon interaction, including the critical temperature of conventional superconductors, the carrier mobility in semiconductors, the temperature dependence of optical spectra in direct and indirect-gap semiconductors, the relaxation rates of photoexcited carriers, the electron mass renormalization in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and the nonadiabatic corrections to phonon dispersion relations. In this article a review of the theoretical and computational framework underlying modern electron-phonon calculations from first principles as well as landmark investigations of the electron-phonon interaction in real materials is given. The first part of the article summarizes the elementary theory of electron-phonon interactions and their calculations based on density-functional theory. The second part discusses a general field-theoretic formulation of the electron-phonon problem and establishes the connection with practical first-principles calculations. The third part reviews a number of recent investigations of electron-phonon interactions in the areas of vibrational spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, transport, and superconductivity.}

In our atomic calculations, the SIC-LDA yields total energies, ionization energies, and charge densities that are superior to results obtained with the local density approximation (LDA). However, for molecules, SIC-LDA gives bond lengths and reaction energies that are inferior to those obtained from LDA. The nonlocal Beck-Lee-Yang-Parr functional, which we include as a representative generalized gradient approximation functional, outperforms both LDA and SIC-LDA for all ground-state properties we considered.}

In the realm of theoretical spectroscopy, the GW method provides access to charged excitations as measured in direct or inverse photoemission spectroscopy. The number of GW calculations in the past two decades has exploded with increased computing power and modern codes. The success of GW can be attributed to many factors: favorable scaling with respect to system size, a formal interpretation for charged excitation energies, the importance of dynamical screening in real systems, and its practical combination with other theories. In this review, we provide an overview of these formal and practical considerations. We expand, in detail, on the choices presented to the scientist performing GW calculations for the first time. We also give an introduction to the many-body theory behind GW, a review of modern applications like molecules and surfaces, and a perspective on methods which go beyond conventional GW calculations. This review addresses chemists, physicists and material scientists with an interest in theoretical spectroscopy. It is intended for newcomers to GW calculations but can also serve as an alternative perspective for experts and an up-to-date source of computational techniques.}

The analysis based on self-entanglement also leads to a surprising interpretation of the failure of the convexity relation for model Hamiltonians such as the Hubbard model: The failure is due to the existence of self-entangled states with lower energies than the ground state so that in such models decoherence, i.e., disentangling from the self-entangled states, would cost energy and disallow the observation of the state through measurement. The Hubbard model is discussed extensively in an appendix where we also discuss and resolve some of the counterarguments to the convexity relation that have been advanced in the literature.},

Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 4845789 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 71340403 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran2003, PERL scripts, Python scripts. Classification: 7.3, 7.8. External routines: (all optional) BigDFT [2], ETSF\_IO [3], libxc [4], NetCDF [5], MPI [6], Wannier90 [7], FFTW [8]. Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEEU\_v1\_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 180 (2009) 2582 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. The abinit-7.10.5 version is now the up to date stable version of ABINIT Nature of problem: This package has the purpose of computing accurately material and nanostructure properties: electronic structure, bond lengths, bond angles, primitive cell size, cohesive energy, dielectric properties, vibrational properties, elastic properties, optical properties, magnetic properties, non-linear couplings, electronic and vibrational life-times, and others. Solution method: Software application based on Density Functional Theory, Many-Body Perturbation Theory and Dynamical Mean Field Theory, pseudopotentials, with plane waves or wavelets as basis functions. Reasons for new version: Since 2009, the abinit-5.7.4 version of the code has considerably evolved and is not yet up to date. The abinit- 7.10.5 version contains new physical and technical features that allow electronic structure calculations impossible to carry out in the previous versions. Summary of revisions:{$\bullet$}new physical features: quantum effects for the nuclei treated by the Path-integral Molecular Dynamics; finding transition states using image dynamics (NEB or string methods); two component DFT for electron-positron annihilation; linear response in a Projector Augmented-Wave approach -PAW-, electron-phonon interactions and temperature dependence of the gap; Bethe Salpeter Equation -BSE-; Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT).{$\bullet$}new technical features: development of a PAW approach for a wavelet basis; parallelisation of the code on more than 10,000 processors; new build system.{$\bullet$}new features in the ABINIT package: tests; test farm; new tutorials; new pseudopotentials and PAW atomic data tables; GUI and postprocessing tools like the AbiPy and APPA libraries.Running time: It is difficult to answer to the question as the use of ABINIT is very large. On one hand, ABINIT can run on 10,000 processors for hours to perform quantum molecular dynamics on large systems. On the other hand, tutorials for students can be performed on a laptop within a few minutes.

(Phys Rev Lett, 1982, 49, 1691) and by Sham and Schl\"uter (Phys Rev Lett. 1983, 51, 1884) that the exact Kohn--Sham exchange-correlation potential of an open system may jump discontinuously as the particle number crosses an integer, with important physical consequences. Recently, Sagvolden and Perdew (Phys Rev A 2008, 77, 012517) have analyzed the discontinuity of the exchange-correlation potential as the particle number crosses one, with an illustration that uses a model density for the H- ion. In this work, we extend their analysis to the case in which the external potential is the simple harmonic confinement, choosing spring-constant values for which the two-electron hamiltonian has an analytic solution. This way, we can obtain the exact, analytic, exchange and correlation potentials for particle number fluctuating between zero and two, illustrating the discontinuity as the particle number crosses one without introducing any model or approximation. We also discuss exchange and correlation separately. \copyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2009},

  abstract = {It is shown how to properly construct exchange-correlation (xc) potentials in the Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory such that physically meaningful KS eigenvalues result. A potential adjustor {$\Delta$}HxcN- is derived which enables for any approximate functional for the xc energy the construction of a consistent xc potential leading to an eigenvalue of the energetically highest occupied KS orbital equal to the negative of the ionization potential. Together with a second potential adjustor {$\Delta$}HxcN+ KS band structures can be converted in approximate quasiparticle band structures exhibiting the exact physical instead of the KS band gap. This represents an alternative route to the fundamental quasiparticle band gap, completely within the KS formalism without the need to resort to many-body perturbation theory approaches like the GW method. It is shown that, for any finite system, approximate xc potentials including those in the local density and generalized gradient approximations, in contrast to common belief, always exhibit consistent nonzero discontinuities at integer electron numbers, if constructed properly. Thus the discontinuity of xc potentials is identified as a derived quantity which emerges automatically by properly constructing xc potentials without the need to be specifically incorporated in approximate xc functionals. It is demonstrated that all relevant objects of the ensemble KS formalism, in particular functional derivatives and their discontinuities, can be expressed in terms of quantities readily available in the KS formalism of integer electron numbers within an approach named integer electron ensemble approach (IEEA). Attempts to specifically construct ensemble density functionals are shown to be needless. Taking the known asymptotic behavior of the electron density into account an internal consistency condition for xc potentials is presented which justifies tuning procedures of xc functionals and, furthermore, indicates how asymptotic corrections for xc potentials have to be properly employed.}

  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) has greatly expanded our ability to affordably compute and understand electronic ground states, by replacing intractable ab initio calculations by models based on paradigmatic physics from high- and low-density limits. But, a comparable treatment of excited states lags behind. Here, we solve this outstanding problem by employing a generalization of density functional theory to ensemble states (EDFT). We thus address important paradigmatic cases of all electronic systems in strongly (low-density) and weakly (high-density) correlated regimes. We show that the high-density limit connects to recent, exactly solvable EDFT results. The low-density limit reveals an unnoticed and most unexpected result---density functionals for strictly correlated ground states can be reused directly for excited states. Nontrivial dependence on excitation structure only shows up at third leading order. Overall, our results provide foundations for effective models of excited states that interpolate between exact low- and high-density limits, which we illustrate on the cases of singlet-singlet excitations in H2 and a ring of quantum wells.}

  abstract = {A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C(6) x R(-6). A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol(-1). The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C(6) x R(-6) terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.}

To this end, the unaltered r2SCAN functional is combined with a tailor-made triple-{$\zeta$} Gaussian atomic orbital basis set as well as with refitted D4 and geometrical counter-poise corrections for London-dispersion and basis set superposition error. The performance of the new method is evaluated for the GMTKN55 database covering large parts of chemical space with about 1500 data points, as well as additional benchmarks for non-covalent interactions, organometallic reactions, and lattice energies of organic molecules and ices, as well as for the adsorption on polar salt and non-polar coinage-metal surfaces. These comprehensive tests reveal a spectacular performance and robustness of r2SCAN-3c: It by far surpasses its predecessor B97-3c at only twice the cost and provides one of the best results of all semi-local density-functional theory (DFT)/QZ methods ever tested for the GMTKN55 database at one-tenth of the cost. Specifically, for reaction and conformational energies as well as non-covalent interactions, it outperforms prominent hybrid-DFT/QZ approaches at two to three orders of magnitude lower cost. Perhaps, the most relevant remaining issue of r2SCAN-3c is self-interaction error (SIE), owing to its mGGA nature. However, SIE is slightly reduced compared to other (m)GGAs, as is demonstrated in two examples. After all, this remarkably efficient and robust method is chosen as our new group default, replacing previous composite DFT and partially even expensive high-level methods in most standard applications for systems with up to several hundreds of atoms.}

The material properties, including the electron-phonon interaction, are calculated from first principles. We provide a detailed description of the normalized full-band relaxation time approximation for the linearized Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) that includes inelastic scattering processes. The bulk electron-phonon coupling is evaluated by a supercell method. The method employed is fully numerical and does therefore not require a semianalytic treatment of part of the problem and, importantly, it keeps the anisotropy information stored in the coupling as well as the band structure. In addition, we perform calculations of the low-field mobility and its dependence on carrier density and temperature to obtain a better understanding of transport in graphene, silicene, and monolayer MoS2. Unlike graphene, the carriers in silicene show strong interaction with the out-of-plane modes. We find that graphene has more than an order of magnitude higher mobility compared to silicene in the limit where the silicene out-of-plane interaction is reduced to zero (by substrate interaction, clamping, or similar). If the out-of-plane interaction is not actively reduced, the mobility of silicene will essentially be zero. For MoS2, we obtain several orders of magnitude lower mobilities compared to graphene in agreement with other recent theoretical results. The simulations illustrate the predictive capabilities of the newly implemented BTE solver applied in simulation tools based on first-principles and localized basis sets.}

  abstract = {The dioxygen formation mechanism of biological water oxidation in nature has long been the focus of argument; many diverse mechanistic hypotheses have been proposed. Based on a recent breakthrough in the resolution of the electronic and structural properties of the oxygen-evolving complex in the S3 state, our density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the open-cubane oxo--oxyl coupling mechanism, whose substrates preferably originate from W2 and O5 in the S2 state, emerges as the best candidate for O--O bond formation in the S4 state. This is justified by the overwhelming energetic superiority of this mechanism over alternative mechanisms in both the isomeric open and closed-cubane forms of the Mn4CaO5 cluster; spin-dependent reactivity rooted in variable magnetic couplings was found to play an essential role. Importantly, this oxygen evolution mechanism is supported by the recent discovery of femtosecond X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL), and the origin of the observed structural changes from the S1 to S3 state has been analyzed. In this view, we corroborate the proposed water binding mechanism during S2--S3 transition and correlate the theoretical models with experimental findings from aspects of substrate selectivity according to water exchange kinetics. This theoretical consequence for native metalloenzymes may serve as a significant guide for improving the design and synthesis of biomimetic materials in the field of photocatalytic water splitting.}

Taking silicon as a prototypical example, we compare experimental high energy photoemission spectra with GW calculations and analyze the origin of the GW failure. We then propose an approximation to the functional differential equation that determines the exact one-body Green's function, whose solution has an exponential form. This yields a calculated spectrum, including cross sections, secondary electrons, and an estimate for extrinsic and interference effects, in excellent agreement with experiment. Our result can be recast as a dynamical vertex correction beyond GW, giving hints for further developments.}

As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate this representation in the case of low-energy spin-singlet and -triplet excitons in cubic lithium fluoride, computed using the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. We visualize the resulting maximally localized exciton Wannier functions (MLXWFs) in real space, detail the convergence of the exciton Wannier spreads, and demonstrate how Wannier-Fourier interpolation can be leveraged to obtain exciton energies and states at arbitrary exciton crystal momenta in the Brillouin zone. We further introduce an approach to treat the long-range dipolar coupling between singlet MLXWFs and discuss it in depth. The MLXWF representation sheds light on the fundamental nature of excitons and paves the way toward Wannier-based post-processing of excitonic properties, enabling the construction of ab initio exciton tight-binding models, efficient interpolation of the exciton-phonon vertex, the computation of Berry curvature associated with exciton bands, and beyond.}

The presented BDEs appear to have an (estimated) 3{$\sigma$} error less than 1 kJ/mol relative to the exact solutions to the nonrelativistic Born--Oppenheimer Hamiltonian. These benchmark values were used to assess the performance of a wide range of standard single reference CC models, as the results should be beneficial for understanding the limitations of these models for transition metal systems.

  abstract = {Density Functional Theory has become very widely used to study the electronic structure and related properties of transition metal complexes. Despite the many successes obtained using modern functionals, care is still needed as quite large errors can occur. These can be best understood by taking into consideration how density functional theory works, and how well it performs for the simpler case of main-group compounds. This serves to highlight the critical role of the exchange functional, which describes such varied effects as electron self-interaction, static (or non-dynamic) correlation, and dynamic correlation. A poor balance between these effects can lead to significant errors even for main-group compounds. This is even truer for transition metal compounds. Benchmark data published in the last year suggest that all existing functionals can lead to severe errors for some transition metal compounds. There is a slight trend for systems involving more static correlation to be treated better using second- or third-generation gradient-corrected or kinetic energy density functionals, rather than hybrid functionals. This trend is however quite variable from one type of compound to another. Computed spin-state splittings are highly variable from one functional to another, and this is also diagnostic of differences in the extent of static correlation. The increasing awareness of transition metal compounds by the developers of new exchange--correlation functionals should lead in the medium term to more accurate and hence (even) more useful functionals.}

  abstract = {Although the self-interaction terms in the Coulomb and exchange potentials exactly cancel each other in the Hartree-Fock one-electron Hamiltonian, the cancellation is incomplete when the exchange interaction is treated by the density-functional approximation. The residual self-interaction pushes the orbital energy levels upward. This effect is especially serious for valence states of insulators with localized charge distribution and causes an underestimation of the energy band gap. We have corrected for this incomplete cancellation of self-interaction in the density-functional formalism of energy-band theory of crystalline solids. The self-interaction correction (SIC) to the total energy of the N-electron system is expressed in terms of the Wannier functions, and periodic SIC potentials for the Bloch-state wave functions are derived variationally from the energy functional. The resulting SIC one-electron Hamiltonians are state dependent, but a unified Hamiltonian has been devised so that energies of all levels of the same {$\rightarrow$}k from different bands are obtained by diagonalizing the same matrix. We have applied this SIC method to calculate the energy band structure of the argon and LiCl crystals. Using the Kohn-Sham exchange along with the correlation potential of von Barth and Hedin, we obtain band gaps in excellent agreement with experiment, whereas without SIC the calculated band gaps are more than 35\% below the experimental values.}

  abstract = {The use of fractional occupation of energy levels in the self-interaction-corrected local spin density (SIC-LSD) theory of electronic energy structure is studied with reference to calculation of ionization and excitation energies. With the original form of the SIC-LSD energy functional for fractional occupation, the one-electron eigenvalues exhibit nonlinear dependence on the occupation number. A new SIC-LSD density functional for fractional occupation based on the general behavior of the universal functional is proposed. The one-electron eigenvalues derived from this new functional vary quite linearly with the occupation number. This makes it possible to obtain ionization and excitation energies by a simple numerical integration over the occupation number. A one-point integration gives ionization energies that agree on the average with the results on taking the difference in self-consistent-field total energy between the atom and the ion to within 0.4\% for the atoms He, Li, Be,...,Ar. Improvement can be made by using a three-point integration over the occupation number. This method is also applied to calculate excitation energies of selected transitions for He through Ar and the results are in good agreement with the corresponding total-energy differences.}

  abstract = {A set of successively more accurate self-consistent equations for the one-electron Green's function have been derived. They correspond to an expansion in a screened potential rather than the bare Coulomb potential. The first equation is adequate for many purposes. Each equation follows from the demand that a corresponding expression for the total energy be stationary with respect to variations in the Green's function. The main information to be obtained, besides the total energy, is one-particle-like excitation spectra, i.e., spectra characterized by the quantum numbers of a single particle. This includes the low-excitation spectra in metals as well as configurations in atoms, molecules, and solids with one electron outside or one electron missing from a closed-shell structure. In the latter cases we obtain an approximate description by a modified Hartree-Fock equation involving a "Coulomb hole" and a static screened potential in the exchange term. As an example, spectra of some atoms are discussed. To investigate the convergence of successive approximations for the Green's function, extensive calculations have been made for the electron gas at a range of metallic densities. The results are expressed in terms of quasiparticle energies E(k) and quasiparticle interactions f(k, k{$\prime$}). The very first approximation gives a good value for the magnitude of E(k). To estimate the derivative of E(k) we need both the first- and the second-order terms. The derivative, and thus the specific heat, is found to differ from the free-particle value by only a few percent. Our correction to the specific heat keeps the same sign down to the lowest alkali-metal densities, and is smaller than those obtained recently by Silverstein and by Rice. Our results for the paramagnetic susceptibility are unreliable in the alkali-metal-density region owing to poor convergence of the expansion for f. Besides the proof of a modified Luttinger-Ward-Klein variational principle and a related self-consistency idea, there is not much new in principle in this paper. The emphasis is on the development of a numerically manageable approximation scheme.},

Use of these atomic orbitals in self-consistent molecular-orbital calculations is shown to lead to values of atomization energies, atomic populations, and electric dipole moments which converge rapidly (with increasing size of Gaussian expansion) to the values appropriate for pure Slater-type orbitals. The {$\zeta$} exponents (or scale factors) for the atomic orbitals which are optimized for a number of molecules are also shown to be nearly independent of the number of Gaussian functions. A standard set of {$\zeta$} values for use in molecular calculations is suggested on the basis of this study and is shown to be adequate for the calculation of total and atomization energies, but less appropriate for studies of charge distribution.}

  abstract = {The calculation of the electronic properties of materials is an important task of solid-state theory, albeit particularly difficult if electronic correlations are strong, e.g., in transition metals, their oxides and in f-electron systems. The standard approach to material calculations, the density functional theory in its local density approximation (LDA), incorporates electronic correlations only very rudimentarily and fails if the correlations are strong. Encouraged by the success of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) in dealing with strongly correlated model Hamiltonians, physicists from the bandstructure and the many-body communities have joined forces and developed a combined LDA + DMFT method recently. Depending on the strength of electronic correlations, this new approach yields a weakly correlated metal as in the LDA, a strongly correlated metal or a Mott insulator. This approach is widely regarded as a breakthrough for electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated materials. We review this LDA + DMFT method and also discuss alternative approaches to employ DMFT in electronic structure calculations, e.g., by replacing the LDA part with the so-called GW approximation. Different methods to solve the DMFT equations are introduced with a focus on those that are suitable for realistic calculations with many orbitals. An overview of the successful application of LDA + DMFT to a wide variety of materials, ranging from Pu and Ce, to Fe and Ni, to numerous transition metal oxides, is given.}

In particular, we study the convergence of the EKT IEs to their exact values as the basis set and the active space sizes vary. We find that the first FCI EKT IEs approach their exact counterparts as the basis set size increases. However, increasing the basis set or the active space sizes do not always lead to more accurate CAS-CI EKT IEs. Our investigation supports the Davidson et al.'s observation [E. R. Davidson, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 155, 051102 (2021)] that the FCI EKT IEs can be systematically improved with arbitrary numerical accuracy by supplementing the basis set with diffuse functions of appropriate symmetry which allow the detached electron to travel far away from the reference system. By changing the exponent and the center of the diffuse functions, our results delineate a complex pattern for the CAS-CI EKT IE of LiH which can be important for the spectroscopic studies of small molecules.},

With this robust setup, we can identify an appropriate computational scheme that provides the best compromise between computational demand and accuracy. A complete database considering Berlin green and Prussian blue and white for all alkaline cations is presented.}

This combination decreases the onset potential of BiVO4 by {$\sim$}0.8 V (down to 0.3 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and increases the photovoltage by 0.45 V. The presence of the catalyst also leads to a remarkable 6-fold enhancement of the photocurrent at 1.23 V versus RHE, while keeping the light-harvesting ability of BiVO4. Structural and mechanistic studies indicate that CoFe-PB effectively acts as a true catalyst on BiVO4. This mechanism, stemming from the adequate alignment of the energy levels, as showed by density functional theory calculations, allows CoFe-PB to outperform all previous catalyst/BiVO4 junctions and, in addition, leads to noteworthy long-term stabilit...},

Meanwhile, linear-scaling (LS) approaches to density functional theory (DFT) allow for simulation of thousands of atoms in feasible computational effort. This article describes an adaptation of PAW for use in the LS-DFT framework provided by the ONETEP LS-DFT package. ONETEP uses optimisation of the density matrix through in situ -optimised local orbitals rather than the direct calculation of eigenstates as in traditional PAW approaches. The method is shown to be comparably accurate to both PAW and AE approaches and to exhibit improved convergence properties compared to norm-conserving pseudopotential methods.}

  abstract = {Relative to the standard provided by an unconstrained five-coordinate imidazoleiron(II) porphyrin, the axial separation (N(epsilon)...P(mu)) in deoxyhemoglobin of the complexed histidine-nitrogen (N(epsilon)) atom from the mean plane (P(mu)) of the protoporphyrin is stretched by [unk] 0.30 A. Retention of the same globin framework (quaternary structure) in deoxycobaltohemoglobin implies an axial connection with the cobalt protoporphyrin that carries enhanced tension, but a somewhat smaller value of N(epsilon)...P(mu) than the 2.90 A observed in deoxyhemoglobin. Structural constraints imposed on and by the globin in support of tension in the axial linkage are conducive to doming of the entire 24-atom porphine skeleton of the protoporphyrin toward the metal (M) atom. Furthermore, the presence of an odd electron in the 3d(z) (2) orbital of the metal atom is responsible for an easily stretched M-N(epsilon) bond. It then appears that moderate doming of the porphinato core in combination with modest stretch in the Co-N(epsilon) bond can readily lead to an N(epsilon)...P(mu) distance approaching 2.90 A in deoxycobaltohemoglobin and, consequently, to compatibility with Perutz's postulated trigger for the initiation of cooperative interaction of the subunits during the reversible oxygenation of hemoglobin.}

  abstract = {The Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction (SIC) to local and semilocal density functionals systematically underestimates molecular bond lengths, yet improves many other ground-state properties. An alternative definition of a SIC is reached by using the Perdew-Zunger energy with a global, multiplicative Kohn-Sham potential instead of the orbital-specific potentials of traditional SIC. Due to the unitary variance of the SIC energy, the most general construction of the SIC Kohn-Sham potential involves a unitary transformation of the Kohn-Sham orbitals. We systematically investigate the Kohn-Sham version of the SIC, in particular with respect to the bond-length question, and present a detailed analysis of the influence of different unitary transformations. Using a complex-valued energy-minimizing transformation appears to be the most favorable approach, and we explain this result by analyzing orbital densities. We discuss how to calculate the transformations efficiently.}

  abstract = {Quantum impurity solvers have a broad range of applications in theoretical studies of strongly correlated electron systems. Especially, they play a key role in dynamical mean-field theory calculations of correlated lattice models and realistic materials. Therefore, the development and implementation of efficient quantum impurity solvers is an important task. In this paper, we present an open source interacting quantum impurity solver toolkit (dubbed iQIST). This package contains several highly optimized quantum impurity solvers which are based on the hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, as well as some essential pre- and post-processing tools. We first introduce the basic principle of continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm and then discuss the implementation details and optimization strategies. The software framework, major features, and installation procedure for iQIST are also explained. Finally, several simple tutorials are presented in order to demonstrate the usage and power of iQIST.

Computer: Desktop PC, laptop, high performance computing cluster. Operating system: Unix, Linux, Mac OS X, Windows. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes, it is parallelized by MPI and OpenMP RAM: Depends on the complexity of the problem Classification: 7.3. External routines: BLAS, LAPACK, Latex is required to build the user manual. Nature of problem: Quantum impurity models were originally proposed to describe magnetic impurities in metallic hosts. In these models, the Coulomb interaction acts between electrons occupying the orbitals of the impurity atom. Electrons can hop between the impurity and the host, and in an action formulation, this hopping is described by a time-dependent hybridization function. Nowadays quantum impurity models have a broad range of applications, from the description of heavy fermion systems, and Kondo insulators, to quantum dots in nano-science. They also play an important role as auxiliary problems in dynamical mean-field theory and its diagrammatic extensions [1--3], where an interacting lattice model is mapped onto a quantum impurity model in a self-consistent manner. Thus, the accurate and efficient solution of quantum impurity models becomes an essential task. Solution method: The quantum impurity model can be solved by the numerically exact continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method, which is the most efficient and powerful impurity solver for finite temperature simulations. In the iQIST software package, we implemented the hybridization expansion version of continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Both the segment representation and general matrix formalism are supported. The key idea of this algorithm is to expand the partition function diagrammatically in powers of the impurity-bath hybridization, and to stochastically sample these diagrams to all relevant orders using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. For a detailed review of the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithms, please refer to [4]. Running time: Depends on the complexity of the problem. The sample run supplied in the distribution takes about 1.5 minutes. References: [1] A. Georges, G. Kotliar, W. Krauth, and M. J. Rozenberg, Rev. Mod. Phys. 68, 13 (1996) [2] G. Kotliar, S. Y.

  abstract = {The conventional linear response overestimates the U in DFT+U calculations for solids with fully occupied orbitals. Here, we demonstrate that the challenge arises from the incomplete cancellation of the electron--electron Coulomb repulsion energy under external perturbation. We applied the second charge response, denoted as the ``pseudo-charge'' model, to offset such residue effects. Counteracting between these two charge response-induced Coulomb potentials, the U parameters are self-consistently obtained by fulfilling the conditions for minimizing the non-Koopmans energy. Moreover, the pseudo-charge-induced repulsive potential shows a screening behavior related to the orbital occupation and is potentially in compliance with the screened exact exchange--correlation of electrons. The resultant U parameters are self-consistent solutions for improved band structure calculations by the DFT+U method. This work extends the validity of the linear response method to both partially and fully occupied orbitals and gives a reference for estimating the Hubbard U parameter prior to other advanced methods. The U parameters were determined in a transferability test using both PBE and hybrid density functional methods, and the results showed that this method is independent of the functional. The electronic structures determined from the hybrid-DFT+Uhybrid approach are provided. Comparisons are also made with the recently developed self-consistent hybrid-DFT+Uw method.}

Unlike most TMOs, minute doping in CaMnO3 induces a metallic state without any structural transformations. This material is thus an ideal platform to explore band formation through the MIT. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to visualize how electrons delocalize and couple to phonons in CaMnO3. We show the development of a Fermi surface where mobile electrons coexist with heavier carriers, strongly coupled polarons. The latter originate from a boost of the electron-phonon interaction (EPI). This finding brings to light the role that the EPI can play in MITs even caused by purely electronic mechanisms. Our discovery of the EPI-induced dichotomy of the charge carriers explains the transport response of Ce-doped CaMnO3 and suggests strategies to engineer quantum matter from TMOs.},

The full dielectric matrix is used to evaluate the self-energy operator in the GW approximation: the first term in an expansion of the self-energy operator in terms of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction (W) and the dressed Green's function (G). Quasiparticle energies are calculated for the homopolar materials diamond, Si, and Ge as well as for the ionic compound LiCl. The results are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. In particular, the indirect band gap is calculated as 5.5, 1.29, and 0.75 eV as compared with experimental gaps of 5.48, 1.17, and 0.744 eV for diamond, Si, and Ge, respectively. The Ge results include relativistic effects. The calculated direct gap for LiCl is within 5\% of experiment. Viewed as a correction to the density-functional eigenvalues calculated with the local-density approximation, the present results show a correction dominated by a large jump at the gap. It is found that because of the charge inhomogeneity, the full dielectric screening matrix must be included, i.e., local-field effects are essential. The dynamical effects are also found to be crucial. The required dielectric matrices are obtained within the density-functional approach for the static case and extended to finite frequency with use of a generalized plasmon-pole model based on sum rules. The model reproduces the {$\omega$} and {$\omega-$}1 moments of the exact many-body response function. The qualitative features of the electron self-energy operator are discussed. Using the static Coulomb-hole--screened-exchange approximation for illustration, the role of local fields in the self-energy operator are explained. The role of dynamical renormalization is illustrated. The same qualitative features are observed in both the homopolar and ionic materials., This article appears in the following collection:}

  abstract = {As a ground-state expectation value, the static dielectric response function can be obtained exactly within the density-functional approach. This approach is developed in the present paper within the local-density approximation. The ab initio pseudopotential method is used, extending the techniques that give excellent structural properties to the calculation of dielectric response functions. In particular, the full dielectric matrix is calculated, and so complete information about local fields is obtained. In contrast to recently proposed direct methods for obtaining the dielectric response matrices, the present approach is based on the usual perturbation formulation for the independent-particle polarizability. The results agree well with results obtained with use of direct methods. The advantage of the perturbative approach is that it allows calculation of the response matrices on a systematic grid of points in the Brillouin zone without significant extra computation or loss of accuracy for points of low symmetry. The response matrices for such a grid are required to describe the response to arbitrary perturbations, e.g., a local change in the potential due to an impurity or defect. The role of exchange and correlation is carefully developed and the relation of the response functions calculated within the density-functional approach to the usual random-phase approximation is illustrated. Results from first principles for the full static dielectric matrices are given for a series of semiconductors and insulators: diamond, Si, Ge, and LiCl. Comparison is made to previous results based on empirical potentials. The importance of local fields is illustrated for the macroscopic dielectric function and by using the concept of the dielectric band structure. Sufficient details of the method and results are included to serve as a reference for development of the dielectric matrix as a tool to be used in other applications. In particular, the additional terms in the long-wavelength dielectric matrix due to nonlocal terms in the ionic pseudopotential are presented.}

Koopmans compliant (KC) functionals are an accurate and computationally efficient alternative to many-body perturbation theory using the GW approximation but have yet only been validated on a small number of simple materials. In this work, KC functionals were applied to the more complex case of Cs2TiBr6 and gave a zero-temperature fundamental gap of 4.28 eV, in close agreement with the value of 4.44 eV obtained using the accurate, but more computationally expensive, evGW0 approach. The temperature-dependent renormalization of the bandgap has also been investigated and found to be significant. Agreement with the experimental optical bandgaps of 1.76--2.0 eV would also require the inclusion of exciton binding energy.}

The right-elongated (R) Mna-XMnd and left-elongated (L) MnaX-Mnd structures appear to occupy local minima on a double-well potential for several key intermediates in these states. The effects of insertion of one extra water molecule to the vacant coordination site\{,\} Mnd (Mna)\{,\} for R (L) structures have also been examined in detail. The greater stability of the L-type structure over the R-type has been concluded for key intermediates in the S2 and S3 states.

Our results demonstrate how important the dynamic behavior of surrounding water molecules is in mediating critical chemical transformations such as binding and deprotonation of substrates and hydration of the catalytic site and identify a strong coupling of water-chain relocation near the redox-active tyrosine residue Tyr161 (TyrZ) with oxidation of the Mn4CaO5 cluster by TyrZ({$\bullet$}+). The oxidation reaction is further promoted when the catalytic site is more solvated by water. These results indicate the importance of surrounding water molecules in biological catalysts as they ultimately lead to effective catalytic function and/or favorable electron-transfer dynamics.},

For a chosen 340-atom model, 1 stable and 11 metastable intermediates have been identified within the range of 13 kcal mol?1 that differ in protonation, charge, spin, and conformational states. The results imply that reversible interconversion of these intermediates gives rise to dynamic equilibria that involve processes with relocations of protons and electrons residing in the Mn4CaO5 cluster, as well as bound water ligands, with concomitant large changes in the cluster geometry. Such proton tautomerism and redox isomerism are responsible for reversible activation/deactivation processes of substrate oxygen species, through which Mn?O and O?O bonds are transiently ruptured and formed. These results may allow for a tentative interpretation of kinetic data on substrate water exchange on the order of seconds at room temperature, as measured by time-resolved mass spectrometry. The reliability of the hybrid DFT method for the multielectron redox reaction in such an intricate system is also addressed.},

We performed herein hybrid DFT calculations within the broken-symmetry formalism and associated analyses of Heisenberg spin models to study the electronic and spin structures of various isomeric structural motifs (hydroxo--oxo, oxyl--oxo, peroxo, and superoxo species) in the S3 state. Our extensive study reveals several factors that affect the spin ground state: (1) (formal) Mn oxidation state; (2) metal--ligand covalency; (3) coordination geometry; and (4) structural change of the Mn cluster induced by alternations in Mn{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}Mn distances.

To this end we devise an ideal scanning tunneling microscope (STM) setup and employ the recently proposed steady-state DFT formalism (i-DFT) which allows one to calculate the steady current through a nanoscopic region coupled to two biased electrodes. In our setup, one of the electrodes serves as a probe (``STM tip''), which is weakly coupled to the system we want to measure. In the ideal STM limit of vanishing coupling to the tip, the system is restored to quasi-equilibrium and the normalized differential conductance yields the exact equilibrium many-body spectral function. Calculating this quantity from i-DFT, we derive an exact relation expressing the interacting spectral function in terms of the Kohn--Sham one. As illustrative examples, we apply our scheme to calculate the spectral functions of two nontrivial model systems, namely the single Anderson impurity model and the Constant Interaction Model.}

  abstract = {First-principles modeling of systems with localized d states is currently a great challenge in condensed-matter physics. Density-functional theory in the standard local-density approximation (LDA) proves to be problematic. This can be partly overcome by including local Hubbard U corrections (LDA+U) but itinerant states are still treated on the LDA level. Many-body perturbation theory in the GW approach offers both a quasiparticle perspective (appropriate for itinerant states) and an exact treatment of exchange (appropriate for localized states), and is therefore promising for these systems. LDA+U has previously been viewed as an approximate GW scheme. We present here a derivation that is simpler and more general, starting from the static Coulomb-hole and screened exchange approximation to the GW self-energy. Following our previous work for f -electron systems we conduct a systematic investigation of the GW method based on LDA+U (GW@LDA+U), as implemented in our recently developed all-electron GW code FHI-gap (Green's function with augmented plane waves) for a series of prototypical d -electron systems: (1) ScN with empty d states, (2) ZnS with semicore d states, and (3) late transition-metal oxides (MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) with partially occupied d states. We show that for ZnS and ScN, the GW band gaps only weakly depend on U but for the other transition-metal oxides the dependence on U is as strong as in LDA+U. These different trends can be understood in terms of changes in the hybridization and screening. Our work demonstrates that GW@LDA+U with "physical" values of U provides a balanced and accurate description of both localized and itinerant states. \copyright{} 2010 The American Physical Society.}

Solar cells with the efficiencies of 21.6\% in small size (0.0737 cm2) and 20.1\% in large size (1 cm2) with moderate residual PbI2 in perovskite layer are obtained.

We have developed a new set of PAW atomic data files for most of the stable elements in the periodic table. These files are provided in a standard XML format for use in any PAW electronic structure code. The new dataset performs well as measured by the ``{$\Delta$}'' evaluation criterion introduced by Lejaeghere et al.

Theory Comput. 2014, 10, 642) is presented and an implementation thereof is described. Results are shown for systems with periodicity in one, two, and three dimensions as well as isolated molecules. The generalized Pipek--Mezey Wannier functions (PMWF) are highly localized orbitals consistent with chemical intuition where a distinction is maintained between {$\sigma$}- and {$\pi$}-orbitals. The PMWF method is compared with the so-called maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) that are frequently used for the analysis of condensed matter calculations. Whereas PMWFs maximize the localization criterion of Pipek and Mezey, MLWFs maximize that of Foster and Boys and have the disadvantage of mixing {$\sigma$}- and {$\pi$}-orbitals in many cases. The PMWF orbitals turn out to be as localized as the MLWF orbitals as evidenced by cross-comparison of the values of the PMWF and MLWF objective functions for the two types of orbitals. Our implementation in the atomic simulation environment (ASE) is compatible with various representations of the wave function, including real-space grids, plane waves, and linear combinations of atomic orbitals. The projector-augmented wave formalism for the representation of atomic core electrons is also supported. Results of calculations with the GPAW software are described here, but our implementation can also use output from other electronic structure software such as ABINIT, NWChem, and VASP.}

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria and plants carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. They use water to generate the atmospheric oxygen we breathe and carbon dioxide to produce the biomass serving as food, feed, fibre and fuel. This paper scans the emergence of structural and mechanistic understanding of oxygen evolution over the past 50 years. It reviews speculative concepts and the stepped insight provided by novel experimental and theoretical techniques. Driven by sunlight photosystem II oxidizes the catalyst of water oxidation, a hetero-metallic Mn 4 CaO 5 (H 2 O) 4 cluster. Mn 3 Ca are arranged in cubanoid and one Mn dangles out. By accumulation of four oxidizing equivalents before initiating dioxygen formation it matches the four-electron chemistry from water to dioxygen to the one-electron chemistry of the photo-sensitizer. Potentially harmful intermediates are thereby occluded in space and time. Kinetic signatures of the catalytic cluster and its partners in the photo-reaction centre have been resolved, in the frequency domain ranging from acoustic waves via infra-red to X-ray radiation, and in the time domain from nano- to milli-seconds. X-ray structures to a resolution of 1.9~\AA{} are available. Even time resolved X-ray structures have been obtained by clocking the reaction cycle by flashes of light and diffraction with femtosecond X-ray pulses. The terminal reaction cascade from two molecules of water to dioxygen involves the transfer of four electrons, two protons, one dioxygen and one water. A rigorous mechanistic analysis is challenging because of the kinetic enslaving at millisecond duration of six partial reactions (4e - , 1H + , 1O 2 ). For the time being a peroxide-intermediate in the reaction cascade to dioxygen has been in focus, both experimentally and by quantum chemistry. Homo sapiens has relied on burning the products of oxygenic photosynthesis, recent and fossil. Mankind's total energy consumption amounts to almost one-fourth of the global photosynthetic productivity. If the average power consumption equalled one of those nations with the highest consumption per capita it was four times greater and matched the total productivity. It is obvious that biomass should be harvested for food, feed, fibre and platform chemicals rather than for fuel.}

However, it remains unanswered whether the reactions efficiently proceed throughout the S-state cycle retaining the native structures of the intermediates in PSII crystals. We investigated the water oxidation reactions in the PSII microcrystals using flash-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy. In comparison with the FTIR spectra in solution, it was shown that all of the metastable intermediates in the microcrystals retained their native structures, and the efficiencies of the S-state transitions remained relatively high, although those of the S2 {$\rightarrow$} S3 and S3 {$\rightarrow$} S0 transitions were slightly lowered possibly due to some restriction of water movem...}

Furthermore abnormally weak bands are also confirmed at 22.7, 24.1, and 26.8 eV in the Hell spectrum.}

Each of them contains a reaction centre that is surrounded by light-harvesting antennae, which absorb the light and transfer the excitation energy to the reaction centre where electron transfer reactions are driven. Here we report a critical test for two contrasting models of light harvesting by photosystem II cores, known as the trap-limited and the transfer-to-the trap-limited model. Oriented single crystals of photosystem II core complexes of Synechococcus elongatus are excited by polarized visible light and the transient absorption is probed with polarized light in the infrared. The dichroic amplitudes resulting from photoselection are maintained on the 60ps timescale that corresponds to the dominant energy transfer process providing compelling evidence for the transfer-to-the-trap limitation of the overall light-harvesting process. This finding has functional implications for the quenching of excited states allowing plants to survive under high light intensities. 1},

In S2, H2O at the W1 site forms a low-barrier H-bond with D1-Asp61.

  abstract = {Inspired by the period-four oscillation in flash-induced oxygen evolution of photosystem II discovered by Joliot in 1969, Kok performed additional experiments and proposed a five-state kinetic model for photosynthetic oxygen evolution, known as Kok's S-state clock or cycle1,2. The model comprises four (meta)stable intermediates (S0, S1, S2 and S3) and one transient S4 state, which precedes dioxygen formation occurring in a concerted reaction from two water-derived oxygens bound at an oxo-bridged tetra manganese calcium (Mn4CaO5) cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex3-7. This reaction is coupled to the two-step reduction and protonation of the mobile plastoquinone QB at the acceptor side of PSII. Here, using serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography and simultaneous X-ray emission spectroscopy with multi-flash visible laser excitation at room temperature, we visualize all (meta)stable states of Kok's cycle as high-resolution structures (2.04-2.08 \AA ). In addition, we report structures of two transient states at 150 and 400 \textmu s, revealing notable structural changes including the binding of one additional 'water', Ox, during the S2{$\rightarrow$}S3 state transition. Our results suggest that one water ligand to calcium (W3) is directly involved in substrate delivery. The binding of the additional oxygen Ox in the S3 state between Ca and Mn1 supports O-O bond formation mechanisms involving O5 as one substrate, where Ox is either the other substrate oxygen or is perfectly positioned to refill the O5 position during O2 release. Thus, our results exclude peroxo-bond formation in the S3 state, and the nucleophilic attack of W3 onto W2 is unlikely.},

  abstract = {Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a method that measures orbital and band structure contrast through the momentum distribution of photoelectrons. Its simplest interpretation is obtained in the plane-wave approximation, according to which photoelectrons propagate freely to the detector. The photoelectron momentum distribution is then essentially given by the Fourier transform of the real-space orbital. While the plane-wave approximation is remarkably successful in describing the momentum distributions of aromatic compounds, it generally fails to capture kinetic-energy-dependent final-state interference and dichroism effects. Focusing our present study on quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene as the archetypical two-dimensional (2D) material, we observe an exemplary Ekin-dependent modulation of, and a redistribution of spectral weight within, its characteristic horseshoe signature around the \textasciimacron K and \textasciimacron K{$\prime$} points: both effects indeed cannot be rationalized by the plane-wave final state. Our data are, however, in remarkable agreement with ab initio time-dependent density functional simulations of a freestanding graphene layer and can be explained by a simple extension of the plane-wave final state, permitting the two dipole-allowed partial waves emitted from the C 2pz orbitals to scatter in the potential of their immediate surroundings. Exploiting the absolute photon flux calibration of the Metrology Light Source, this scattered-wave approximation allows us to extract Ekin-dependent amplitudes and phases of both partial waves directly from photoemission data. The scattered-wave approximation thus represents a powerful yet intuitive refinement of the plane-wave final state in photoemission of 2D materials and beyond.}

In all of these models, a deprotonated form of the second substrate moves to a position next to O5 during the catalytic step immediately prior to O--O bond formation. In this study, FTIR difference spectroscopy was employed to identify the vibrational modes of hydrogen-bonded water molecules that are altered by the substitution of Sr2+ for Ca2+.

  abstract = {Accurate computational predictions of band gaps are of practical importance to the modeling and development of semiconductor technologies, such as (opto)electronic devices and photoelectrochemical cells. Among available electronic-structure methods, density-functional theory (DFT) with the Hubbard U correction (DFT+U) applied to band edge states is a computationally tractable approach to improve the accuracy of band gap predictions beyond that of DFT calculations based on (semi)local functionals. At variance with DFT approximations, which are not intended to describe optical band gaps and other excited-state properties, DFT+U can be interpreted as an approximate spectral-potential method when U is determined by imposing the piecewise linearity of the total energy with respect to electronic occupations in the Hubbard manifold (thus removing self-interaction errors in this subspace), thereby providing a (heuristic) justification for using DFT+U to predict band gaps. However, it is still frequent in the literature to determine the Hubbard U parameters semiempirically by tuning their values to reproduce experimental band gaps, which ultimately alters the description of other total-energy characteristics. Here, we present an extensive assessment of DFT+U band gaps computed using self-consistent ab initio U parameters obtained from density-functional perturbation theory to impose the aforementioned piecewise linearity of the total energy. The study is carried out on 20 compounds containing transition-metal or p-block (group III-IV) elements, including oxides, nitrides, sulfides, oxynitrides, and oxysulfides. By comparing DFT+U results obtained using nonorthogonalized and orthogonalized atomic orbitals as Hubbard projectors, we find that the predicted band gaps are extremely sensitive to the type of projector functions and that the orthogonalized projectors give the most accurate band gaps, in satisfactory agreement with experimental data. This work demonstrates that DFT+U may serve as a useful method for high-throughput workflows that require reliable band gap predictions at moderate computational cost.},

  abstract = {Self-consistent calculations using the Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction (PZ-SIC) to local density and gradient dependent energy functionals are presented for the binding energy and equilibrium geometry of small molecules as well as energy barriers of reactions. The effect of the correction is to reduce binding energy and bond lengths and increase activation energy barriers when bond breaking is involved. The accuracy of the corrected functionals varies strongly, the correction to the binding energy being too weak for the local density approximation but too strong for the gradient dependent functionals considered. For the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, a scaling of the PZ-SIC by one half gives improved results on average for both binding energy and bond lengths. The PZ-SIC does not necessarily give more accurate total energy, but it can result in a better cancellation of errors. An essential aspect of these calculations is the use of complex orbitals. A restriction to real orbitals leads to less accurate results as was recently shown for atoms [S. Kl\"upfel, P. Kl\"upfel, and H. J\'onsson, Phys. Rev. A\hphantom{,}84, 050501 (2011)10.1103/PhysRevA.84.050501]. The molecular geometry of radicals can be strongly affected by PZ-SIC. An incorrect, non-linear structure of the C2H radical predicted by PBE is corrected by PZ-SIC. The CH3 radical is correctly predicted to be planar when complex orbitals are used, while it is non-planar when the PZ-SIC calculation is restricted to real orbitals.}

  abstract = {Impurities and defects frequently govern materials properties, with the most prominent example being the doping of bulk semiconductors where a minute amount of foreign atoms can be responsible for the operation of the electronic devices. Several computational schemes based on a supercell approach have been developed to get insights into types and equilibrium concentrations of point defects, which successfully work in bulk materials. Here, we show that many of these schemes cannot directly be applied to two-dimensional (2D) systems, as formation energies of charged point defects are dominated by large spurious electrostatic interactions between defects in inhomogeneous environments. We suggest two approaches that solve this problem and give accurate formation energies of charged defects in 2D systems in the dilute limit. Our methods, which are applicable to all kinds of charged defects in any 2D system, are benchmarked for impurities in technologically important h-BN and MoS2 2D materials, and they are found to perform equally well for substitutional and adatom impurities.}

These interpolations can be performed at the global (integrated over all spaces) or at the local level, using energy densities. Many features of the relevant energy densities as well as several different ways to construct these interpolations, including comparisons between global and local variants, are investigated here for the analytically solvable Hooke's atom series, which allows for an exploration of different correlation regimes. We also analyze different ways to define the correlation kinetic energy density, focusing on the peak in the kinetic correlation potential.},

However, commonly used approximate density functionals produce total energies that do not exhibit this piecewise-linear behavior. As a result, the ionization potential theorem, equating the highest occupied eigenvalue with the ionization potential, is grossly disobeyed. Here, we show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, most of the required piecewise linearity of an arbitrary approximate density functional can be restored by careful consideration of the ensemble generalization of density-functional theory. Furthermore, the resulting formulation introduces the desired derivative discontinuity to any approximate exchange-correlation functional, even one that is explicitly density dependent. This opens the door to calculations of the ionization potential and electron affinity, even without explicit electron removal or addition. All these advances are achieved while neither introducing empiricism nor changing the underlying functional form. The power of the approach is demonstrated on benchmark systems using the local density approximation as an illustrative example.}

Different from many former approaches in the theories of information and also in biosemiotics, we will show that the forms of meaning emerge simultaneously (alongside) with information and energy. Hence, information is always meaningful (in a sense to be explicated) rather than its meaning would show up as a later specification of information within social systems only. This perspective taken has two immediate consequences: (1) We follow the GDI as defined by Floridi, though we modify it somehow as to the aspect of truthfulness. (2) We can conceptually solve Capurro's trilemma. Hence, what we actually do is to follow the strict (i.e. optimistic) line of UTI in the sense of Hofkirchner's. While doing this, we treat energy and information as two different categorial aspects of one and the same underlying primordial structure.},

  abstract = {The redox potential of synthetic oligonuclear transition metal complexes has been shown to correlate with the Lewis acidity of a redox-inactive cation connected to the redox-active transition metals of the cluster via oxo or hydroxo bridges. Such heterometallic clusters are important cofactors in many metalloenzymes, where it is speculated that the redox-inactive constituent ion of the cluster serves to optimize its redox potential for electron transfer or catalysis. A principal example is the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II of natural photosynthesis, a Mn4CaO5 cofactor that oxidizes water into dioxygen, protons and electrons. Calcium is critical for catalytic function, but its precise role is not yet established. In analogy to synthetic complexes it has been suggested that Ca2+ fine-tunes the redox potential of the manganese cluster. Here we evaluate this hypothesis by computing the relative redox potentials of substituted derivatives of the oxygen-evolving complex with the cations Sr2+, Gd3+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Sc3+, Na+ and Y3+ for two sequential transitions of its catalytic cycle. The theoretical approach is validated with a series of experimentally well-characterized Mn3AO4 cubane complexes that are structural mimics of the enzymatic cluster. Our results reproduce perfectly the experimentally observed correlation between the redox potential and the Lewis acidities of redox-inactive cations for the synthetic complexes. However, it is conclusively demonstrated that this correlation does not hold for the oxygen evolving complex. In the enzyme the redox potential of the cluster only responds to the charge of the redox-inactive cations and remains otherwise insensitive to their precise identity, precluding redox-tuning of the metal cluster as a primary role for Ca2+ in biological water oxidation.},

  abstract = {In transition-metal complexes, the geometric structure is intimately connected with the spin state arising from magnetic coupling between the paramagnetic ions. The tetramanganese--calcium cofactor that catalyzes biological water oxidation in photosystem II cycles through five catalytic intermediates, each of which adopts a specific geometric and electronic structure and is thus characterized by a specific spin state. Here, we review spin--structure correlations in Nature's water-splitting catalyst. The catalytic cycle of the Mn4O5Ca cofactor can be described in terms of spin-dependent reactivity. The lower ``inactive'' S states of the catalyst, S0 and S1, are characterized by low-spin ground states, SGS = 1/2 and SGS = 0. This is connected to the ``open cubane'' topology of the inorganic core in these states. The S2 state exhibits structural and spin heterogeneity in the form of two interconvertible isomers and is identified as the spin--switching point of the catalytic cycle. The first S2 state form is an open...}

  abstract = {Heterogeneity in intermediate catalytic states of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of Photosystem II is known from a wide range of experimental and theoretical data, but its potential implications for the mechanism of water oxidation remain unexplored. We delineate the consequences of structural heterogeneity for the final step of the catalytic cycle by tracing the evolution of three spectroscopically relevant and structurally distinct components of the last metastable S3 state to the transient O2-evolving S4 state of the OEC. Using quantum chemical calculations, we show that each S3 isomer leads to a different electronic structure formulation for the active S4 state. Crucially, in addition to previously hypothesized Mn(IV)-oxyl species, we establish for the first time, how a genuine Mn(V)-oxo can be obtained in the catalytically active S4 state: this takes the form of a five-coordinate and locally high-spin (SMn\,=\,1) Mn(V) site. This formulation for the S4 state evolves naturally from a preceding S3-state structural intermediate that contains a quasi-trigonal-bipyramidal Mn(IV) ion. The results strongly suggest that water binding in the S3 state is not prerequisite for reaching the oxygen-evolving S4 state of the complex, supporting the notion that both substrates are preloaded at the beginning of the catalytic cycle. This scenario allows true four-electron metal-centered hole accumulation to precede OO bond formation and hence the latter can proceed via a genuine even-electron mechanism. This can occur as intramolecular nucleophilic coupling of two oxo units synchronously with the binding of a water substrate for the next catalytic cycle.}

  abstract = {Excitation gaps are of considerable significance in electronic structure theory. Two different gaps are of particular interest. The fundamental gap is defined by charged excitations, as the difference between the first ionization potential and the first electron affinity. The optical gap is defined by a neutral excitation, as the difference between the energies of the lowest dipole-allowed excited state and the ground state. Within many-body perturbation theory, the fundamental gap is the difference between the corresponding lowest quasi-hole and quasi-electron excitation energies, and the optical gap is addressed by including the interaction between a quasi-electron and a quasi-hole. A long-standing challenge has been the attainment of a similar description within density functional theory (DFT), with much debate on whether this is an achievable goal even in principle. Recently, we have constructed and applied a new approach to this problem. Anchored in the rigorous theoretical framework of the generalized Kohn--Sham equation, our method is based on a range-split hybrid functional that uses exact long-range exchange. Its main novel feature is that the range-splitting parameter is not a universal constant but rather is determined from first principles, per system, based on satisfaction of the ionization potential theorem. For finite-sized objects, this DFT approach mimics successfully, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the quasi-particle picture of many-body theory. Specifically, it allows for the extraction of both the fundamental and the optical gap from one underlying functional, based on the HOMO--LUMO gap of a ground-state DFT calculation and the lowest excitation energy of a linear-response time-dependent DFT calculation, respectively. In particular, it produces the correct optical gap for the difficult case of charge-transfer and charge-transfer-like scenarios, where conventional functionals are known to fail. In this perspective, we overview the formal and practical challenges associated with gap calculations, explain our new approach and how it overcomes previous difficulties, and survey its application to a variety of systems.}

Three conditions that must be obeyed by the exact energy functional, but may or may not be obeyed by approximate ones, are often pointed out as important in general and for accurate computation of spectroscopic observables in particular. These are: (1) piecewise linearity as a function of the fractional particle number, (2) freedom from one-electron self-interaction, and (3) for a finite system, the functional derivative with respect to the density results in an asymptotic -1/r potential (in Hartree atomic units), where r is the distance from the system center. In this overview, we explain what these conditions are, what they address, and why each one is of importance for spectroscopy. We then show, using specific examples from the literature, that these three properties are related, but are not equivalent and need to be assessed individually.},

We tested it with a donor--acceptor complex, consisting of a furan and a 1,1-dicyanoethylene (DCNE), in which two low lying charge transfer and local excitation states are involved. With generalized M\"ulliken-Hush and fragment charge-difference schemes, couplings from the QE approach generally agree well with those obtained from TDDFT, except that QE couplings exhibit better exponential distance dependence. Couplings from half-energy gaps with an external field are also calculated and reported. Our results show that the QE scheme is robust in calculating ET couplings with greatly reduced computational time.}

Commonly used quasiparticle approximation for the Green's function and static approximation for the screened interaction are avoided altogether. Using alkali metals Na and K as well as semiconductor Si and wide-gap insulator LiF as examples, it is shown that both the vertex corrections in the polarizability P and in the self-energy are important. Particularly, vertex corrections in with proper treatment of frequency dependence of the screened interaction always reduce calculated bandwidths/band gaps, improving the agreement with experiment. The complexity of the vertex included in P and in can be different. Whereas in the case of polarizability one generally has to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the corresponding vertex function, it is enough (for the materials in this study) to include the vertex of the first order in the self-energy. The calculations with appropriate vertices show remarkable improvement in the calculated bandwidths and band gaps as compared to the self-consistent GW approximation as well as to the self-consistent quasiparticle GW approximation.}

  abstract = {Application of the virial theorem to the interelectronic Coulomb repulsion shows that the virial of the exchange potential yields the exchange energy. However, the virial of the correlation potential does not yield the correlation energy. We have recently constructed a ``hypercorrelated'' potential whose virial is the correlation energy. We apply these ideas to a system which contains two interacting electrons in an external harmonic potential, Hooke's atom. This system can be solved analytically for a set of spring constants and numerically for any spring constant. By inverting the Kohn--Sham equations, the exact exchange and correlation potentials can be found. These exact values are compared with several popular approximate functionals, namely local spin density (LSD), Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE), and Becke and Lee--Yang--Parr (BLYP). We illustrate our results for two values of the spring constant. At a moderate value, the density is comparable to the He atom, while for a low spring constant, we explore extremely low densities. \copyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {First-principles Hubbard-corrected approximate density-functional theory (DFT+U) is a low-cost, potentially high throughput method of simulating materials, but it has been hampered by empiricism and inconsistent band-gap correction in transition-metal oxides. DFT+U property prediction of non-magnetic systems such as d0 and d10 transition-metal oxides is typically faced with excessively large calculated Hubbard U values, and with difficulty in obtaining acceptable band-gaps and lattice volumes. Meanwhile, Hund's exchange coupling J is an important but often neglected component of DFT+U, and the J parameter has proven challenging to directly calculate by means of linear response. In this work, we provide a revised formula for computing Hund's J using established self-consistent field DFT+U codes. For non-magnetic systems, we introduce a non-approximate technique for calculating U and J simultaneously in such codes, at no additional cost. Using unmodified Quantum ESPRESSO, we assess the resulting values using two different DFT+U functionals incorporating J, namely the widely used DFT+(U-J) and the readily available DFT+U+J. We assess a test set comprising TiO2, ZrO2, HfO2, Cu2O and ZnO, and apply the corrections both to metal and oxygen centered pseudoatomic subspaces. Starting from the PBE functional, we find that DFT+(U-J) is significantly out-performed in band-gap accuracy by DFT+U+J, the RMS band-gap error of which matches that of the hybrid functional HSE06. ZnO, a long-standing challenge case for DFT+U, is addressed by means of Zn 4s instead of Zn 3d correction, in which case the first-principles DFT+U+J band-gap error is half of that reported for HSE06.},

  abstract = {We discuss the analytic and diagrammatic structure of ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theory, in order to put it on equal footing with the prevalent GW approximation. The comparison is most straightforward for the time-ordered one-particle Green's function, and we show that the Green's function calculated by EOM-CC with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD) includes fewer ring diagrams at higher order than does the GW approximation, due to the former's unbalanced treatment of time-ordering. However, the EOM-CCSD Green's function contains a large number of vertex corrections, including ladder diagrams, mixed ring-ladder diagrams, and exchange diagrams. By including triple excitations, the EOM-CCSDT Green's function includes all diagrams contained in the GW approximation, along with many high-order vertex corrections. In the same language, we discuss a number of common approximations to the EOM-CCSD equations, many of which can be classified as elimination of diagrams. Finally, we present numerical results by calculating the principal charged excitations energies of the molecules contained in the so-called GW100 test set [ J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2015, 11, 5665-5687 ]. We argue that (in molecules) exchange is as important as screening, advocating for a Hartree-Fock reference and second-order exchange in the self-energy.}

Results for the temperature dependence of the parameters of these critical points, labeled {$E$}'0, {$E$}1, {$E$}2, and {$E$}'1, are presented.

  abstract = {Calculations in Kohn--Sham density functional theory crucially rely on high-quality approximations for the exchange-correlation (xc) functional. Standard local and semi-local approximations fail to predict the ionization potential (IP) and the fundamental gap, departing from the Kohn--Sham orbital energies, due to the deviation of the total energy from piecewise-linearity and the absence of the derivative discontinuity. The ensemble generalization procedure introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 126403 (2013) restores, to a large extent, these features in any approximate xc functional and improves its ability to predict the IP and the fundamental gap with negligible additional computational effort. In this work we perform an extensive study of atoms and first ions across the Periodic Table, generalizing the local spin-density and the Perdew--Burke--Ernzerhof approximations. By applying the ensemble generalization to a variety of systems, with s-, p-, and d-character, we assess the accuracy of the method and identify important trends. In particular, we find that the accuracy of our approach heavily depends on the character of the frontier orbitals: when d-orbitals are involved, the performance is far less accurate. Possible sources of error are discussed and ways for further improvement are outlined.}

A simplifying approximation allowing the use of real canonical orbitals is proposed. The algorithm is based on two-step self-consistent field iterations, where the updates of the canonical orbitals and the optimal orbitals are done separately. Calculations of the energy of atoms ranging from H to Ar are presented, using various generalized gradient functionals (PBE, APBE, PBEsol) and a meta-generalized gradient functional (TPSS). While the energy of atoms is poorly described by PBEsol, which is a functional optimized to reproduce properties of solids, the PZ-SIC brings the calculations into good agreement with the best ab initio estimates. The importance of using complex optimal orbitals becomes particularly clear in calculations using the TPSS functional, where the original functional gives good results while the application of PZ-SIC with real orbitals gives highly inaccurate results. With complex optimal orbitals, PZ-SIC slightly improves the accuracy of the TPSS functional. The charge localization problem that plagues Kohn--Sham DFT functionals, including hybrid functionals, is illustrated by calculations on the CH3 + F-- complex, where even PBEsol with PZ-SIC is found to give estimates of both energy and charge with accuracy comparable to that of coupled cluster calculations.}

  abstract = {Band bending at semiconductor surfaces and interfaces is the key to applications ranging from classical transistors to topological quantum computing. A semiconductor particularly important for optical as well as microwave devices is GaN. What makes the material useful is not only its large bandgap but also that it can be heavily doped to become metallic. Here, we apply soft-x-ray angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to metallic Si-doped GaN to explore the electron density and momentum-resolved band dispersions of the valence and conduction electrons varying through the surface band-bending region. We find an upward band bending, where the measured band occupation reduces toward the surface, as probed with low photon energies {$<$}0.5keV. The band occupation approaches the bulk value, matching Hall effect measurements, as the photon energy increases to {$>$}1.4keV, where the photoelectron mean free path exceeds the spatial extent of the band-bending region. Our quantitative analysis of the experimental data describes the potential variation in the band-bending region via self-consistent Poisson-Schr\"odinger equations. We put forward an insightful model to simulate the ARPES spectra from this region through summing up the contribution from all atomic layers, weighted by the photoelectron mean free path, under in-phase conditions achieved at particular values of the photoelectron out-of-plane momentum. The model adequately describes the peculiarities of the ARPES spectra caused by the surface band bending, including the photon-energy dependence of the apparent band occupation and Fermi-surface area, and allows accurate determination of the band-bending profile and values of the photoelectron mean free path. Finally, comparison of our data with supercell density functional theory calculations reveals the preferential location of Si atoms as substitutional for Ga, with the doped electrons entering the GaN conduction bands without formation of separate impurity states as would occur for Si interstitials. Our theoretical and experimental results resolve fundamental questions underpinning device performance of the GaN-based and other semiconductor materials in general and demonstrate a general methodology for quantitative studies of electron states in the band-bending region.}

For silicon, we obtain 11.3 for {$\varepsilon$}1({$\omega$}=0), compared to 11.7 for experiment, 13.1 in our LDA calculation, and 8.4 in a naive self-energy corrected theory (i.e., simply modifying the eigenvalues without modifying the momentum operator).

  abstract = {Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron-electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density rho. Q[rho] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Psi(rho) which yield the fixed. rho. Q[rho] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron-electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix gamma, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree-Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.}

The x-ray photoelectron spectra of cubic GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InP, InAs, InSb, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdTe, and HgTe, and of hexagonal ZnO, CdS, and CdSe were obtained from freshly cleaved single crystals, in the 0-50-eV binding-energy range, using monochromatized Al K{$\alpha$} (1486.6 eV) radiation. The binding energies of the outermost d shells are reported. They were determined relative both to the top of the valence bands (EVB) and to the Fermi level of a thin layer of gold that was vapor deposited after each run (EFB). These data also yielded accurate measures of sample charging. The Fermi level fell near the center of the gap for six samples, near the top for two, and near the bottom for three. Evidence for an apparent increase in core d-level spin-orbit splitting over free-atom values was interpreted as a possible spreading of a {$\Gamma$}7 and a {$\Gamma$}8 level from the upper (d32) {$\Gamma$}8 level by a tetrahedral crystal field. The s, p valence-band spectra showed three main peaks, with considerable structure on the "least-bound" peak. A discussion is given of the validity of comparing the valence-band (VB) spectrum I{$\prime$}(E) with the VB density of states, including cross-section modulation, final-state modulation, and relaxation effects. Characteristic binding energies of spectral features in I{$\prime$}(E) are tabulated. In addition, the energies of the characteristic symmetry points L3, X5, W2, {$\Sigma$}min1, W1, X3(L1), X1, L1, and {$\Gamma$}1 are given for the 11 cubic compounds. These are compared with UPS results where available and with theoretical band-structure results where available. The energies calculated using the relativistic-orthogonalized-plane-wave approach with X{$\alpha\beta$} exchange agree very well with experiment, on the whole. In particular, they predict the important "ionicity gap" X3-X1 quite accurately. The densities of states calculated using the empirical-psuedopotential method provided a useful basis for relating features in I{$\prime$}(E) to energies of the characteristic symmetry points. Band-structure calculations in combination with x-ray-photoemission spectra appear to provide a very powerful approach to establishing the total valence-band structure of semiconductors.}

Using a newly developed single electron-counting detector, we confirmed that electron beam-induced motion substantially degrades resolution, and we showed that the combination of rapid readout and nearly noiseless electron counting allow image blurring to be corrected to subpixel accuracy, restoring intrinsic image information to high resolution (Thon rings visible to [sim]3 A). Using this approach, we determined a 3.3-A-resolution structure of an [sim]700-kDa protein with D7 symmetry, the Thermoplasma acidophilum 20S proteasome, showing clear side-chain density.

Our novel scheme is applicable to various mainstream density functional approximations. It substantially reduces the delocalization error, as exemplified by the significantly improved description of dissociating molecules, transition-state species, and charge-transfer systems. The usefulness of our novel scheme affirms that the explicit treatment of fractional electron distributions is essentially important for reducing the intrinsic delocalization error associated with approximate density functionals.}

By an analysis based on exchange-only local density approximation and careful examination of the E(N) curve, we find for some systems, there exists a very small concave region, corresponding to adding a small fraction of electrons to the integer system, while the remaining E(N) curve is convex. Several numerical examples are provided as verification. Although the E(N) curve is not convex everywhere in these systems, the previous conclusions on the consequence of the delocalization error in the commonly used density functional approximations, in particular, the underestimation of ionization potential, and the overestimation of electron affinity, and other related issues, remain unchanged. This suggests that instead of using the term convexity, a modified and more rigorous description for the delocalization error is that the E(N) curve lies below the straight line segment across the neighboring integer points for these approximate functionals.},

The electronic structures and chemical-bonding analyses reveal that there exists a general conductive network consisting of the anion X sublattice, which dominates the electrical transport properties of the compounds. Electrical and thermal transport properties of the 41 pnictide and chalcogenide compounds with sufficient band gaps are studied. Pnictide compounds have relatively smaller Seebeck coefficients than the chalcogenide compounds. This is due to the smaller effective masses around the valence band maxima. The electrical conductivities and power factors, however, are better in pnictide compounds. This is because pnictide compounds have high electronic group velocities and electronic relaxation times. Combined with the predictions of lattice thermal conductivities based on the Slack model, 12 novel p-type and n-type ABX2 materials with high ZT values are predicted.}

The QP energies from LOSC, instead of commonly used G0W0 and evGW, are directly used in BSE. We show that the BSE/LOSC approach greatly outperforms the commonly used BSE/G0W0 approach for predicting excitations with different characters. For the calculations of Truhlar--Gagliardi test set containing valence, charge transfer, and Rydberg excitations, BSE/LOSC with the Tamm--Dancoff approximation provides a comparable accuracy to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and BSE/evGW. For the calculations of Stein CT test set and Rydberg excitations of atoms, BSE/LOSC considerably outperforms both BSE/G0W0 and TDDFT approaches with a reduced starting point dependence. BSE/LOSC is, thus, a promising and efficient approach to calculate excitation energies for molecular systems.}

Wannier functions are actively being applied to a wide range of phenomena in condensed matter systems. However, the Wannier-function-based representation is limited to a small number of bands and thus cannot describe the change of wave functions due to various kinds of perturbations, which require sums over an infinite number of bands. Here, we introduce the concept of the Wannier function perturbation, which provides a localized representation of wave function perturbations. Wannier function perturbation theory allows efficient calculation of numerous quantities involving wave function perturbation, among which we provide three applications. First, we calculate the temperature-dependent indirect optical absorption spectra of silicon near the absorption edge nonadiabatically, i.e., differentiating phonon-absorption and phonon-emission processes, and without arbitrary temperature-dependent shifts in energy. Second, we establish a theory to calculate the shift spin conductivity without any band-truncation error. Unlike the shift charge conductivity, an exact calculation of the shift spin conductivity is not possible within the conventional Wannier function methods because it cannot be obtained from geometric quantities for low-energy bands. We apply the theory to monolayer WTe2. Third, we calculate the spin Hall conductivity of the same material again without any band-truncation error. Wannier function perturbation theory is a versatile method that can be readily applied to calculate a wide range of quantities related to various kinds of perturbations.}

  abstract = {Over the past decade we have developed Koopmans functionals, a computationally efficient approach for predicting spectral properties with an orbital-density-dependent functional framework. These functionals impose a generalized piecewise linearity condition to the entire electronic manifold, ensuring that orbital energies match the corresponding electron removal/addition energy differences (in contrast to semilocal DFT, where a mismatch between the two lies at the heart of the band gap problem and, more generally, the unreliability of Kohn--Sham orbital energies). This strategy has proven to be very powerful, yielding molecular orbital energies and solid-state band structures with comparable accuracy to many-body perturbation theory but at greatly reduced computational cost while preserving a functional formulation. This paper reviews the theory of Koopmans functionals, discusses the algorithms necessary for their implementation, and introduces koopmans, an open-source package that contains all of the code and workflows needed to perform Koopmans functional calculations and obtain reliable spectral properties of molecules and materials.}

When combined with solar photovoltaic cells, solar-to-chemical conversion rates should become nearly an order of magnitude more efficient than natural photosynthesis.Science, this issue p. 1210Artificial photosynthetic systems can store solar energy and chemically reduce CO2. We developed a hybrid water splitting--biosynthetic system based on a biocompatible Earth-abundant inorganic catalyst system to split water into molecular hydrogen and oxygen (H2 and O2) at low driving voltages. When grown in contact with these catalysts, Ralstonia eutropha consumed the produced H2 to synthesize biomass and fuels or chemical products from low CO2 concentration in the presence of O2. This scalable system has a CO2 reduction energy efficiency of \textasciitilde 50\% when producing bacterial biomass and liquid fusel alcohols, scrubbing 180 grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour of electricity.

  abstract = {The S2 state of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II, which consists of a Mn4O5Ca cofactor, is EPR-active, typically displaying a multiline signal, which arises from a ground spin state of total spin ST = 1/2. The precise appearance of the signal varies amongst different photosynthetic species, preparation and solvent conditions/compositions. Over the past five years, using the model species Thermosynechococcus elongatus, we have examined modifications that induce changes in the multiline signal, i.e. Ca(2+)/Sr(2+)-substitution and the binding of ammonia, to ascertain how structural perturbations of the cluster are reflected in its magnetic/electronic properties. This refined analysis, which now includes high-field (W-band) data, demonstrates that the electronic structure of the S2 state is essentially invariant to these modifications. This assessment is based on spectroscopies that examine the metal centres themselves (EPR, (55)Mn-ENDOR) and their first coordination sphere ligands ((14)N/(15)N- and (17)O-ESEEM, -HYSCORE and -EDNMR). In addition, extended quantum mechanical models from broken-symmetry DFT now reproduce all EPR, (55)Mn and (14)N experimental magnetic observables, with the inclusion of second coordination sphere ligands being crucial for accurately describing the interaction of NH3 with the Mn tetramer. These results support a mechanism of multiline heterogeneity reported for species differences and the effect of methanol [Biochim. Biophys. Acta, Bioenerg., 2011, 1807, 829], involving small changes in the magnetic connectivity of the solvent accessible outer MnA4 to the cuboidal unit Mn3O3Ca, resulting in predictable changes of the measured effective (55)Mn hyperfine tensors. Sr(2+) and NH3 replacement both affect the observed (17)O-EDNMR signal envelope supporting the assignment of O5 as the exchangeable {$\mu$}-oxo bridge and it acting as the first site of substrate inclusion.},

Its reaction cycle is composed of five intermediate (Si) states, where the index i indicates the number of oxidizing equivalents stored by the cofactor. After formation of the S4 state, the product dioxygen is released and the cofactor returns to its lowest oxidation state, S0. Membrane-inlet mass spectrometry measurements suggest that at least one substrate is bound throughout the catalytic cycle, as the rate of 18O-labeled water incorporation into the product O2 is slow, on a millisecond to second timescale depending on the S state. Here, we demonstrate that the Mn4O5Ca complex poised in the S0 state contains an exchangeable hydroxo bridge. Based on a combination of magnetic multiresonance (EPR) spectroscopies, comparison to biochemical models and theoretical calculations we assign this bridge to O5, the same bridge identified in th...}

Most implementations solve the DMFT equations using quantum Monte-Carlo sampling on the imaginary time and frequency (Matsubara) axis. We will here review alternative methods using exact diagonalization, i.e., representing the many-body ground state of the impurity as a sum over Slater determinants and calculating Green's functions using iterative Lanczos procedures. The advantage being that these methods have no sign problem, can handle involved multi-orbital Hamiltonians (low crystal symmetry, spin-orbit coupling) and-when working completely on the real axis-do not need a mathematically ill-posed analytical continuation. The disadvantage of traditional implementations of exact diagonalization has been the exponential scaling of the calculation problem as a function of number of bath discretization points. In the last part we will review how recent advances in exact diagonalization can evade the exponential barrier thereby increasing the number of bath discretization points to reach the thermodynamic limit.}

Our results confirm that P-EOM-MBPT2 can provide reasonable EAs when molecules with significant multireference character are not considered and its mean absolute error on EAs of these molecules is around or less than 0.2 eV. Its accuracy is comparable to that of the more expensive EOM-CCSD(2) method. Results of EOM-CCSD(2), P-EOM-MBPT2, and CIS(D{$\infty$}) indicate that the [[H, ac+], T2] term in the 1h2p-1h block is more important on EAs than the term neglected in the 1h2p-1h2p block in P-EOM-MBPT2. We proposed an economical method where EAs from CIS(D{$\infty$}) are corrected by treating this [[H, ac+], T2] term in the 1h2p-1h block perturbatively [corr-CIS(D{$\infty$})]. EAs with corr-CIS(D{$\infty$}) agree very well with those of P-EOM-MBPT2 with a difference of less than 0.02 eV. Computational scaling of this method is N4 for the iterative part and N5 for some non-iterative steps. Its storage requirement is only of OV3. Corr-CIS(D{$\infty$}) is an economical and reliable method on EAs, and it can be applied to EAs of large molecules.}

  abstract = {We present a first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the pristine and Fe-doped {$\alpha$}-MnO2 using density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals. The onsite U and intersite V Hubbard parameters are determined from first-principles and self-consistently using density-functional perturbation theory in the basis of L\"owdin-orthogonalized atomic orbitals. For the pristine {$\alpha$}-MnO2 we find that the so-called C2-AFM spin configuration is the most energetically favorable, in agreement with the experimentally observed antiferromagnetic ground state. For the Fe-doped {$\alpha$}-MnO2 two types of doping are considered: Fe insertion in the 2 \texttimes{} 2 tunnels and partial substitution of Fe for Mn. We find that the interstitial doping preserves the C2-AFM spin configuration of the host lattice only when both onsite U and intersite V Hubbard corrections are included, while for the substitutional doping the onsite Hubbard U correction alone is able to preserve the C2-AFM spin configuration of the host lattice. The oxidation state of Fe is found to be +2 and +4 in the case of the interstitial and substitutional doping, respectively, while the oxidation state of Mn is +4 in both cases. This work paves the way for accurate studies of other MnO2 polymorphs and complex transition-metal compounds when the localization of 3d electrons occurs in the presence of strong covalent interactions with ligands.}

  abstract = {Wannier functions are real-space representations of Bloch orbitals that provide a useful picture for chemical bonding and offer a localized description of single-particle wave functions. There is a unitary freedom in the construction of Wannier functions from Bloch orbitals, which can be chosen to produce Wannier functions that have advantageous properties. A popular choice for this freedom is the minimization of spatial variance, which leads to maximally localized Wannier functions. We minimize a weighted sum of the spatial and energy variances, yielding what we call dually localized Wannier functions. Localization in energy results in Wannier functions that are associated with a particular energy and allows for dually localized Wannier functions to be comprised of occupied and unoccupied spaces simulatneously. This can lead to Wannier functions that are fractionally occupied, which is a key feature that is used in correcting the delocalization error in density functional approximations. We show how this type of localization results in bonding (antibonding) functions for the occupied (unoccupied) spaces around the frontier energy of silicon in the diamond lattice and of molecular ethylene. Dually localized Wannier functions therefore offer a relevant description for chemical bonding and are well suited to orbital-dependent methods that associate Wannier functions with specific energy ranges without the need to consider the occupied and unoccupied spaces separately.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory offers accurate structure prediction at acceptable computational cost, but commonly used approximations suffer from delocalization error; this results in inaccurate predictions of quantities such as energy band gaps of finite and bulk systems, energy level alignments, and electron distributions at interfaces. The localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) was developed to correct delocalization error by using orbitals localized in space and energy. These localized orbitals span both the occupied and unoccupied spaces and can have fractional occupations in order to correct both the total energy and the one-electron energy eigenvalues. We extend the LOSC method to periodic systems, in which the localized orbitals employed are dually localized Wannier functions. In light of the effect of the bulk environment on the electrostatic interaction between localized orbitals, we modify the LOSC energy correction to include a screened Coulomb kernel. For a test set of semiconductors and large-gap insulators, we show that the screened LOSC method consistently improves the band gap compared to the parent density functional approximation.}

This field of research has experienced an impetuous growth in recent years, due to the technological progress in the generation of ultrashort light pulses and to the development of sophisticated spectroscopic techniques, which greatly increase the amount of information on the process under study. This paper aims at providing a non-exhaustive overview of the state of the art of the field and at pointing out future challenges. We first review the progress in ultrafast optics, which has enabled the generation of broadly tunable light pulses with duration down to a few optical cycles; we then discuss the pump--probe technique, showing examples of its capability to combine very high time resolution, down to the attosecond regime, with broad spectral coverage; we introduce two-dimensional spectroscopy and present results that demonstrate the additional information content provided by the combination of temporal and spectral resolution. Next, we review the achievements of ultrafast X-ray and electron diffraction, which provide time-dependent structural information on photochemical processes, and we conclude with a critical analysis of the future open challenges in the field.}

The strongest change across the transition is found at the topmost valence band edge (VBE), which is commonly associated with the Zhang-Rice bound state. This VBE state strengthens in the AFM phase, but only for the minority spin component, which is subject to stronger fluctuations. A similar hybridized VBE state also appears in the DFT single-particle description of the AFM phase, but gets much stronger and acquires a well-defined energy in the eDMFT description.},

The method is ideal to tame ultrafast light-induced structural transitions in the regime where the photocarriers thermalize faster than the lattice, the electron-hole recombination time is longer than the phonon period, and the photocarrier concentration is large enough to be approximated by an electron-hole plasma. The complete derivation presented here includes total energy, forces and stress tensor, variable cell structural optimization, harmonic vibrational properties, and the electron-phonon interaction. We discuss in detail the case of zone-center optical phonons not conserving the number of electrons and inducing a Fermi shift in the photoelectron and hole distributions. We validate our implementation by comparing with finite differences in Te and VSe2. By calculating the evolution of the phonon spectrum of Te, Si, and GaAs as a function of the fluence of the incoming laser light, we demonstrate that even at low fluences, corresponding to approximately 0.05 photocarriers per atom, the phonon spectrum is substantially modified with respect to the ground-state one with new Kohn anomalies appearing and a substantial softening of zone-center optical phonons. Our implementation can be efficiently used to detect reversible transient phases and irreversible structural transitions induced by ultrafast light absorption.}

Our non-collinear Koopmans-compliant theory involves functionals of four-component orbitals densities, that can be obtained from the charge and spin-vector densities of Wannier functions. We validate our approach on three emblematic and diverse semiconductors where the effect of spin-orbit coupling goes from small to very large: the III-IV semiconductor GaAs, the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe\$\_2\$, and the cubic perovskite CsPbBr\$\_3\$. The predicted band gaps are comparable in accuracy to state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory and include spin-dependent interactions and screening effects that are missing in standard diagrammatic approaches based on the random phase approximation.

  abstract = {The presence of spin-orbit coupling or noncollinear magnetic spin states can have dramatic effects on the ground-state and spectral properties of materials, in particular on the band structure. Here, we develop noncollinear Koopmans-compliant functionals based on Wannier functions and density-functional perturbation theory, targeting accurate spectral properties in the quasiparticle approximation. Our noncollinear Koopmans-compliant theory involves functionals of four-component orbital densities that can be obtained from the charge and spin-vector densities of Wannier functions. We validate our approach on four emblematic nonmagnetic and magnetic semiconductors where the effect of spin-orbit coupling goes from small to very large: the III-IV semiconductor GaAs, the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe2, the cubic perovskite CsPbBr3, and the ferromagnetic semiconductor CrI3. The predicted band gaps are comparable in accuracy to state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory and include spin-dependent interactions and screening effects that are missing in standard diagrammatic approaches based on the random phase approximation. While the inclusion of orbital- and spin-dependent interactions in many-body perturbation theory requires self-screening or vertex corrections, they emerge naturally in the Koopmans-functionals framework.}

  author = {Marzari, Nicola and Souza, Ivo and Vanderbilt, David},
  abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, simultaneous eigenstates of the periodic Hamiltonian and of the direct lattice translations. An alternative representation in terms of localized orbitals has been introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937; besides its theoretical relevance in several areas of solid-state theory, it has gained recent prominence due to its connection with the Berry-phase theory of bulk polarization, the interest in linear-scaling approaches, and with the development of general algorithms to derive Wannier functions in the framework of first-principles electronic structure calculations. The connection between the Bloch representation and the Wannier representation is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. A few years ago we have developed a localization algorithm that allows one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs), extending and encompassing Boys formulation for molecules to the solid-state case. The localization algorithm is independent of the single-particle electronic structure approach adopted, or the choice of basis set, and it is straightforwardly applied to extended or periodic solids and to isolated systems. Additionally, a novel disentanglement procedure allows to extract a maximally-connected manifold of any chosen dimension from a given energy window, leading to the extension of the original algorithm to the case of systems without gaps (e.g., metals) and removing the limitation to isolated groups of bands separated by gaps from higher and lower manifolds. In this Highlight we will outline and summarize the main results of the theory and algorithm underlying the maximally-localized Wannier-functions representation, and review some of the applications that have since appeared in the literature.}

The achieved results can reconcile the apparent inconsistency of experimentally observed deep donor levels with the n-type conductivity observed in reduced TiO2. They show indeed that both defects give rise to vertical transition levels about 1 eV below the conduction band (CB), in agreement with experimental measures, and to thermodynamic transition levels close to the CB. That is, these defects behave as deep donors, when looking at vertical transitions, and as shallow donors, when the effects of the structural relaxations are taken into account.

Among these factors are the (1) generalized Kohn--Sham eigensystem used to construct the GW self-energy and to solve the BSE and (2) the efficacy and suitability of the Tamm--Dancoff approximation. Here, we present a detailed benchmark study of low-lying singlet excitations from a generalized Kohn--Sham (gKS) starting point based on an optimally tuned range-separated hybrid (OTRSH) functional. We show that the use of this gKS starting point with one-shot G0W0 and G0W0-BSE leads to the lowest mean absolute errors (MAEs) and mean signed errors (MSEs), with respect to high-accuracy reference values, demonstrated in the literature thus far for the ionization potentials of the GW100 benchmark set and for low-lying neutral excitations of Thiel's set molecules in the gas phase, without the need for self-consistency. The MSEs and MAEs of one-shot G0W0-BSE@OTRSH excitation energies are comparable to or lower than those obtained with other functional starting points after self-consistency. Additionally, we compare these results with linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations and find GW-BSE to be superior to TDDFT when calculations are based on the same exchange-correlation functional. This work demonstrates tuned range-separated hybrids used in combination with GW and GW-BSE can greatly suppress starting point dependence for molecules, leading to accuracy similar to that for higher-order wavefunction-based theories for molecules without the need for costlier iterations to self-consistency.}

However, the application of LOSC to DFAs was mainly through a post self-consistent field (SCF) manner, and few results from applying LOSC to DFAs in an SCF manner have been reported. The reason is that the originally proposed SCF approach to SCF-LOSC calculation uses an approximate Hamiltonian and encounters convergence problems easily in practice. In this work, we develop a new SCF approach with a correct Hamiltonian and achieve reliable SCF-LOSC calculations. We demonstrate the capability of the new SCF approach for SCF-LOSC to correctly describe the electron densities, total energies, and energy-level alignment for the molecular dissociation process, while conventional DFAs or LOSC-DFAs with post-SCF calculations show large errors. This work demonstrates that the new SCF approach for SCF-LOSC would be a promising method for studying problems for correct electron densities and energy-level alignments in large systems.},

On the basis of extensive numerical results, the SC methods have been demonstrated to be capable of reducing the delocalization error effectively and producing accurate descriptions for many critical and challenging problems, including the fundamental gap, photoemission spectroscopy, charge transfer excitations, and polarizability. In the development of SC methods, the SC methods were mainly implemented in the QM4D package that was developed in the Yang laboratory for research development. The heavy dependency on the QM4D package hinders the SC methods from access by researchers for broad applications. In this work, we developed a reliable and efficient implementation, LibSC, for the global scaling correction (GSC) method and the localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) method. LibSC will serve as a lightweight and open-source library that can be easily accessed by the quantum chemistry community. The implementation of LibSC is carefully modularized to provide the essential functionalities for conducting calculations of the SC methods. In addition, LibSC provides simple and consistent interfaces to support multiple popular programing languages, including C, C++, and Python. In addition to the development of the library, we also integrated LibSC with two popular and open-source quantum chemistry packages, the Psi4 package and the PySCF package, which provides immediate access for general users to perform calculations with SC methods.}

Its popularity can be attributed to many factors, including a favorable scaling and relatively good accuracy. In practical applications, the \$GW\$ is often performed as a one-shot perturbation known as \$G\_0W\_0\$. Unfortunately, \$G\_0W\_0\$ suffers from a strong starting point dependence and is often not as accurate as one would need. Self-consistent \$GW\$ methodologies alleviate these problems but come with a marked increase in computational cost. In this manuscript, we propose the use of an estimate of the exchange-correlation derivative discontinuity to provide a remarkably good starting point for \$G\_0W\_0\$ calculations, yielding ionization potentials and electron affinities with eigenvalue self-consistent \$GW\$ quality at no additional cost. We assess the quality of the resulting methodology with the GW100 benchmark set and compare its advantages over other similar methods.},

  abstract = {Electronic and optical properties of materials are affected by atomic motion through the electron--phonon interaction: not only band gaps change with temperature, but even at absolute zero temperature, zero-point motion causes band-gap renormalization. We present a large-scale first-principles evaluation of the zero-point renormalization of band edges beyond the adiabatic approximation. For materials with light elements, the band gap renormalization is often larger than 0.3\,eV, and up to 0.7\,eV. This effect cannot be ignored if accurate band gaps are sought. For infrared-active materials, global agreement with available experimental data is obtained only when non-adiabatic effects are taken into account. They even dominate zero-point renormalization for many materials, as shown by a generalized Fr\"ohlich model that includes multiple phonon branches, anisotropic and degenerate electronic extrema, whose range of validity is established by comparison with first-principles results.},

  abstract = {The efficient and accurate calculation of how ionic quantum and thermal fluctuations impact the free energy of a crystal, its atomic structure, and phonon spectrum is one of the main challenges of solid state physics, especially when strong anharmonicy invalidates any perturbative approach. To tackle this problem, we present the implementation on a modular Python code of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) method. This technique rigorously describes the full thermodynamics of crystals accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal anharmonic fluctuations. The approach requires the evaluation of the Born--Oppenheimer energy, as well as its derivatives with respect to ionic positions (forces) and cell parameters (stress tensor) in supercells, which can be provided, for instance, by first principles density-functional-theory codes. The method performs crystal geometry relaxation on the quantum free energy landscape, optimizing the free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom of the crystal structure. It can be used to determine the phase diagram of any crystal at finite temperature. It enables the calculation of phase boundaries for both first-order and second-order phase transitions from the Hessian of the free energy. Finally, the code can also compute the anharmonic phonon spectra, including the phonon linewidths, as well as phonon spectral functions. We review the theoretical framework of the SSCHA and its dynamical extension, making particular emphasis on the physical inter pretation of the variables present in the theory that can enlighten the comparison with any other anharmonic theory. A modular and flexible Python environment is used for the implementation, which allows for a clean interaction with other packages. We briefly present a toy-model calculation to illustrate the potential of the code. Several applications of the method in superconducting hydrides, charge-density-wave materials, and thermoelectric compounds are also reviewed.},

The number of sampling points needed to explore the vibrational phase space is reduced by up to an order of magnitude when the full vibrational density is replaced by thermal lines. Calculations of the vibrational averages of several properties and systems are reported, namely, the internal energy and the electronic band gap of diamond and silicon, and the chemical shielding tensor of L-alanine. Thermal lines pave the way for complex calculations of vibrational averages, including large systems and methods beyond semilocal density functional theory.}

Examples include superconductivity, electronic transport, and the temperature dependence of optical spectra. A first-principles description of electron--phonon coupling enables the study of the above phenomena with accuracy and material specificity, which can be used to understand experiments and to predict novel effects and functionality. In this topical review, we describe the first-principles calculation of electron--phonon coupling from finite differences. The finite differences approach provides several advantages compared to alternative methods, in particular (i) any underlying electronic structure method can be used, and (ii) terms beyond the lowest order in the electron--phonon interaction can be readily incorporated. But these advantages are associated with a large computational cost that has until recently prevented the widespread adoption of this method. We describe some recent advances, including nondiagonal supercells and thermal lines, that resolve these difficulties, and make the calculation of electron--phonon coupling from finite differences a powerful tool. We review multiple applications of the calculation of electron--phonon coupling from finite differences, including the temperature dependence of optical spectra, superconductivity, charge transport, and the role of defects in semiconductors. These examples illustrate the advantages of finite differences, with cases where semilocal density functional theory is not appropriate for the calculation of electron--phonon coupling and many-body methods such as the GW approximation are required, as well as examples in which higher-order terms in the electron--phonon interaction are essential for an accurate description of the relevant phenomena. We expect that the finite difference approach will play a central role in future studies of the electron--phonon interaction.},

The success of a DFT+{$U$}(+{$J$}) calculation hinges on the accurate determination of its Hubbard {$U$} and Hund {$J$} parameters, and the linear response (LR) methodology has proven to be computationally effective and accurate for calculating these parameters. This study provides a high-throughput computational analysis of the {$U$} and {$J$} values for transition metal {$d$}-electron states in a representative set of over 1000 magnetic transition metal oxides (TMOs), providing a frame of reference for researchers who use DFT+{$U$} to study transition metal oxides. In order to perform this high-throughput study, an atomate workflow is developed for calculating {$U$} and {$J$} values automatically on massively parallel supercomputing architectures. To demonstrate an application of this workflow, the spin-canting magnetic structure and unit cell parameters of the multiferroic olivine LiNiPO4 are calculated using the computed Hubbard {$U$} and Hund {$J$} values for Ni-{$d$} and O-{$p$} states, and are compared with experiment. Both the Ni-{$dU$} and {$J$} corrections have a strong effect on the Ni-moment canting angle. Additionally, including a O-{$pU$} value results in a significantly improved agreement between the computed lattice parameters and experiment.},

These two conditions are now unified and extended to states with both fractional charge and fractional spin to give a much more stringent condition: the exact energy functional is a plane, linear along the fractional charge coordinate and constant along the fractional spin coordinate with a line of discontinuity at the integer. Violation of this condition underlies the failure of all known approximate functionals to describe the gaps in strongly correlated systems. It is shown that explicitly discontinuous functionals of the density or orbitals that go beyond these currently used smooth approximations is the key for the application of density functional theory to strongly correlated systems. \copyright{} 2009 The American Physical Society.}

Variable temperature variable field (VTVH) Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) spectra in PSII of Thermosynochococcus (T.) vulcanus for each S-state are reported. These spectra, along with assignments, provide a new window into the electronic and magnetic structure of Mn4CaO5. VTVH MCD spectra taken in the S2 state provide a clear g=2, S=1/2 paramagnetic characteristic, which is entirely consistent with that known by EPR. The three features, seen as positive (+) at 749nm, negative (-) at 773nm and (+) at 808nm are assigned as 4A{$\rightarrow$}2E spin-flips within the d3 configuration of the Mn(IV) centres present. This assignment is supported by comparison(s) to spin-flips seen in a range of Mn(IV) materials. S3 exhibits a more intense (-) MCD peak at 764nm and has a stronger MCD saturation characteristic. This S3 MCD saturation behaviour can be accurately modelled using parameters taken directly from analyses of EPR spectra. We see no evidence for Mn(III) d-d absorption in the near-IR of any S-state. We suggest that Mn(IV)-based absorption may be responsible for the well-known near-IR induced changes induced in S2 EPR spectra of T. vulcanus and not Mn(III)-based, as has been commonly assumed. Through an analysis of the nephelauxetic effect, the excitation energy of S-state dependent spin-flips seen may help identify coordination characteristics and changes at each Mn(IV). A prospectus as to what more detailed S-state dependent MCD studies promise to achieve is outlined.}

Some of these approaches use a systematic basis set, the completeness of which may be tuned with an adjustable parameter similar to the energy cut-off of plane-wave techniques. The search for the electronic ground state in such methods suffers from an ill-conditioning which is related to the kinetic contribution to the total energy and which results in unacceptably slow convergence. We present a general preconditioning scheme to overcome this ill-conditioning and implement it within our own first-principles linear-scaling density functional theory method. The scheme may be applied in either real space or reciprocal space with equal success. The rate of convergence is improved by an order of magnitude and is found to be almost independent of the size of the basis.},

  abstract = {In electronic structure methods based on the correction of approximate density-functional theory (DFT) for systematic inaccuracies, Hubbard \$U\$ parameters may be used to quantify and amend the self-interaction errors ascribed to selected subspaces. Here, in order to enable the accurate, computationally convenient calculation of \$U\$ by means of DFT algorithms that locate the ground-state by direct total-energy minimization, we introduce a reformulation of the successful linear-response method for \$U\$ in terms of the fully-relaxed constrained ground-state density. Defining \$U\$ as an implicit functional of the ground-state density implies the comparability of DFT + Hubbard \$U\$ (DFT+\$U\$) total-energies, and related properties, as external parameters such as ionic positions are varied together with their corresponding first-principles \$U\$ values. Our approach provides a framework in which to address the partially unresolved question of self-consistency over \$U\$, for which plausible schemes have been proposed, and to precisely define the energy associated with subspace many-body self-interaction error. We demonstrate that DFT+\$U\$ precisely corrects the total energy for self-interaction error under ideal conditions, but only if a simple self-consistency condition is applied. Such parameters also promote to first-principles a recently proposed DFT+\$U\$ based method for enforcing Koopmans' theorem.},

  abstract = {The free energy surfaces and reaction mechanisms underlying the activation of amino acids by COS in bulk water at ambient conditions as well as extreme temperature-pressure thermodynamic conditions were studied using accelerated ab initio molecular dynamics. The results for the reaction sequence leading from glycine to its activated form, a so-called Leuchs anhydride or {$\alpha$}-amino acid N-carboxyanhydride (NCA), suggest that extreme conditions not far from the critical point of water may favor the formation of this activated species. This is traced back to appropriately affecting relative stabilities of neutral versus charged or zwitterionic molecular species which shifts equilibria, affects relative barriers, and thus modifies reaction rates. Furthermore, it is shown that the N-carboxyanhydride of glycine is not formed from N-thiocarboxyl glycine by its direct cyclization, but instead an indirect mechanism, the so-called isocyanate route, is clearly preferred at both conditions. The work quantitatively underpins the impact of extreme solvent conditions on the investigated organic reactions in aqueous media which implies that the presented results are of relevance to fields such as prebiotic chemistry and green chemistry.}

  abstract = {Standard flavors of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations are known to fail in describing anions, due to large self-interaction errors. The problem may be circumvented using localized basis sets of reduced size, leaving no variational flexibility for the extra electron to delocalize. Alternatively, a recent approach exploiting DFT evaluations of total energies on electronic densities optimized at the Hartree-Fock (HF) level has been reported, showing that the self-interaction-free HF densities are able to lead to an improved description of the additional electron, returning affinities in close agreement with the experiments. Nonetheless, such an approach can fail when the HF densities are too inaccurate. Here, an alternative approach is presented, in which an embedding environment is used to stabilize the anion in a bound configuration. Similar to the HF case, when computing total energies at the DFT level on these corrected densities, electron affinities in very good agreement with experiments can be recovered. The effect of the environment can be evaluated and removed by an extrapolation of the results to the limit of vanishing embedding. Apart from the definition of the domain of the embedding potential, the approach is free from parameters and it can be easily applied to DFT calculations with delocalized basis sets, e.g., plane waves, for which alternative approaches are either not viable or more computationally demanding. The proposed extrapolation strategy can be thus applied also to extended systems, as often studied in condensed-matter physics and materials science, and we illustrate how the embedding environment can be exploited to determine the energy of an adsorbing anion, here a chloride ion on a metal surface, whose charge configuration would be incorrectly predicted by standard density functionals.}

We argue that proofs of these theorems rely critically on the finiteness of the number of particles comprising the considered systems. We revisit the problem with focus on extended systems and we confirm the Koopmans' theorem validity. On the other hand, we establish the IP-theorem's violation within the context of KS DFT of extended systems. These findings have an immediate bearing on the role of the KS valence band at solid surfaces, mesoscopic, and other extended systems with respect to the work-function problem. Based on our results, we introduce a concept of the ionization potential band structure as an observable alternative to its unphysical KS counterpart. A method of practical determination of IP band structure in terms of DFT quantities is provided.},

The cases covered include geometric, electric, magnetic and time-dependent perturbations. The developed theoretical apparatus is then applied to the calculations of molecular structures, vibrational energies as well as a wide variety of properties including absorption, circular dichroism, magnetic circular dichroism, resonance Raman, X-ray absorption, M\"ossbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. Finally, the important subjects of spin state energetics and exchange couplings in oligomeric transition metal clusters is discussed.}

Although the structure of the OEC is known at atomic level for its dark-stable state, the mechanism by which water is oxidized remains unsettled. Important mechanistic information was gained in the past two decades by mass spectrometric studies of the H2(18)O/H2(16)O substrate-water exchange in the four (semi) stable redox states of the OEC. However, until now such data were not attainable in the transient states formed immediately before the O-O bond formation. Using modified photosystem II complexes displaying up to 40-fold slower O2 production rates, we show here that in the transient S3YZ state the substrate-water exchange is dramatically slowed as compared with the earlier S states. This further constrains the possible sites for substrate-water binding in photosystem II.},

This was achieved by selecting the parameters of the functional to satisfy an ansatz that generalizes the ionization potential theorem to the removal of charge from a state that corresponds to a Wannier function. Here, we present applications of the method to the band gaps of typical halide perovskites. We find a satisfyingly small formal mean absolute error of {$\sim$}0.1 eV with respect to experimental band gaps and very good agreement with previous many-body perturbation theory calculations.}

  abstract = {Although the oxidation of water is efficiently catalysed by the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II (refs 1 and 2), it remains one of the main bottlenecks when aiming for synthetic chemical fuel production powered by sunlight or electricity. Consequently, the development of active and stable water oxidation catalysts is crucial, with heterogeneous systems considered more suitable for practical use and their homogeneous counterparts more suitable for targeted, molecular-level design guided by mechanistic understanding. Research into the mechanism of water oxidation has resulted in a range of synthetic molecular catalysts, yet there remains much interest in systems that use abundant, inexpensive and environmentally benign metals such as iron (the most abundant transition metal in the Earth's crust and found in natural and synthetic oxidation catalysts). Water oxidation catalysts based on mononuclear iron complexes have been explored, but they often deactivate rapidly and exhibit relatively low activities. Here we report a pentanuclear iron complex that efficiently and robustly catalyses water oxidation with a turnover frequency of 1,900 per second, which is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of other iron-based catalysts. Electrochemical analysis confirms the redox flexibility of the system, characterized by six different oxidation states between Fe(II)5 and Fe(III)5; the Fe(III)5 state is active for oxidizing water. Quantum chemistry calculations indicate that the presence of adjacent active sites facilitates O-O bond formation with a reaction barrier of less than ten kilocalories per mole. Although the need for a high overpotential and the inability to operate in water-rich solutions limit the practicality of the present system, our findings clearly indicate that efficient water oxidation catalysts based on iron complexes can be created by ensuring that the system has redox flexibility and contains adjacent water-activation sites.},

The compounds investigated comprise the layered AMO2 and AMS2 structures, the olivine and maricite AMPO4 structures, and the NASICON A3V2(PO4)3 structures. The calculated Na voltages for the compounds investigated are 0.18--0.57 V lower than that of the corresponding Li voltages, in agreement with previous experimental data. We believe the observed lower voltages for Na compounds are predominantly a cathodic effect related to the much smaller energy gain from inserting Na into the host structure compared to inserting Li. We also found a relatively strong dependence of battery properties on structural features. In general, the difference between the Na and Li voltage of the same structure, {$\Delta$}VNa--Li, is less negative for the maricite structures preferred by Na, and more negative for the olivine structures preferred by Li. The layered compounds have the most negative {$\Delta$}VNa--Li. In terms of phase stability, we found that open structures, such as the layered and NASICON structures, that are better able to accommodate the larger Na+ ion generally have both Na and Li versions of the same compound. For the close-packed AMPO4 structures, our results show that Na generally prefers the maricite structure, while Li prefers the olivine structure, in agreement with previous experimental work. We also found surprising evidence that the barriers for Na+ migration can potentially be lower than that for Li+ migration in the layered structures. Overall, our findings indicate that Na-ion systems can be competitive with Li-ion systems.}

  abstract = {Electronic excitations lie at the origin of most of the commonly measured spectra. However, the first-principles computation of excited states requires a larger effort than ground-state calculations, which can be very efficiently carried out within density-functional theory. On the other hand, two theoretical and computational tools have come to prominence for the description of electronic excitations. One of them, many-body perturbation theory, is based on a set of Green's-function equations, starting with a one-electron propagator and considering the electron-hole Green's function for the response. Key ingredients are the electron's self-energy {$\Sigma$} and the electron-hole interaction. A good approximation for {$\Sigma$} is obtained with Hedin's GW approach, using density-functional theory as a zero-order solution. First-principles GW calculations for real systems have been successfully carried out since the 1980s. Similarly, the electron-hole interaction is well described by the Bethe-Salpeter equation, via a functional derivative of {$\Sigma$}. An alternative approach to calculating electronic excitations is the time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), which offers the important practical advantage of a dependence on density rather than on multivariable Green's functions. This approach leads to a screening equation similar to the Bethe-Salpeter one, but with a two-point, rather than a four-point, interaction kernel. At present, the simple adiabatic local-density approximation has given promising results for finite systems, but has significant deficiencies in the description of absorption spectra in solids, leading to wrong excitation energies, the absence of bound excitonic states, and appreciable distortions of the spectral line shapes. The search for improved TDDFT potentials and kernels is hence a subject of increasing interest. It can be addressed within the framework of many-body perturbation theory: in fact, both the Green's functions and the TDDFT approaches profit from mutual insight. This review compares the theoretical and practical aspects of the two approaches and their specific numerical implementations, and presents an overview of accomplishments and work in progress.}

Major concerns for the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaic technology to take off include lead toxicity, long-term stability, hysteresis, and optimal bandgap. Therefore, there is still need for further exploration of alternative candidates. Elemental composition engineering of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 has been proposed to address the above concerns. Among the best six certified power conversion efficiencies reported by National Renewable Energy Laboratory on perovskite-based solar cells, five are based on mixed perovskites (e.g., MAPbI1--xBrx, FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45, Cs0.1FA0.75MA0.15PbI2.49Br0.51). In this paper, we review the recent progress on the synthesis and fundamental aspects of mixed cation and halide perovskites correlating with device performance, long-term stability, and hysteresis. In the outlook, we outline the future research directions based on the reported results as well as related topics that warrant further investigation.}

Derived from an Hermitian, intermediately normalized superoperator metric, these methods contain no adjustable parameters. To assess their versatility, a standard set (NIST-50-EA) of 50 vertical electron affinities of small closed-shell molecules based on NIST reference data has been created. Errors with respect to reference data on 23 large, conjugated organic photovoltaic (OPV23) molecules have also been analyzed. All final states are valence anions that correspond to electron affinities between 0.2 and 4.2 eV. For a given scaling of the arithmetic bottleneck, the new-generation methods obtain the lowest mean absolute errors (MAEs). The best methods with fifth-power arithmetic scaling realize MAEs below 0.1 eV. Composite models comprising cubically and quintically scaling calculations executed with large and small basis sets, respectively, produce OPV23 MAEs near 0.05 eV. The accuracy of quintically scaling methods executed with large basis sets is thereby procured with reduced computational effort. New-generation results obtained with and without the diagonal self-energy approximation in the canonical Hartree--Fock basis have been compared. These results indicate that Dyson orbitals closely resemble canonical Hartree--Fock orbitals multiplied by the square root of a probability factor above 0.85.}

We find that a previously proposed extension of first-principles DFT+U to incorporate a Hund's J correction, termed DFT+U+J, in combination with parameters calculated using a recently proposed linear-response theory, predicts fundamental band gaps that are accurate to well within the experimental uncertainty in rutile and anatase TiO2. Our approach builds upon established findings that Hubbard correction of both the titanium 3d and oxygen 2p subspaces in TiO2, symbolically giving DFT+Ud,p, is necessary to achieve acceptable band gaps using DFT+U. This requirement remains when the first-principles Hund's J is included. We also find that the calculated gap depends on the correlated subspace definition even when using subspace-specific first-principles U and J parameters. Using the simplest reasonable correlated subspace definition and underlying functional, the local density approximation, we show that high accuracy results from using a relatively uncomplicated form of the DFT+U+J functional. For closed-shell systems such as TiO2, we describe how various DFT+U+J functionals reduce to DFT+U with suitably modified parameters, so that reliable band gaps can be calculated for rutile and anatase with no modifications to a conventional DFT+U code.}

Dyson orbitals are defined as overlaps between initial, N-electron states and final states with N \textpm{} 1 electrons and therefore are useful in the prediction and interpretation of many kinds of spectroscopic and scattering experiments. They also are characteristic of N-electron initial states and may be used to construct electron densities, one-electron properties, and total energies with correlated Aufbau procedures that include probability factors between zero and unity. Relationships with natural orbitals, Kohn--Sham orbitals, and Hartree--Fock orbitals facilitate insights into the descriptive capabilities of Dyson orbitals. Electron-propagator approximations that employ the Dyson quasiparticle equation or super-operator secular equations enable direct determination of Dyson orbitals and obviate the need for many-electron wavefunctions of initial or final states. Numerical comparisons of the amplitudes and probability factors of Dyson orbitals calculated with several self-energy approximations reveal the effects of electron correlation on these uniquely defined, one-electron wavefunctions.}

The water oxidase in PS II contains a Mn4Ca cluster (oxygen evolving complex\{,\} OEC)\{,\} whose catalytic mechanism has been extensively investigated but is still unresolved. In particular the precise Mn oxidation levels through which the cluster cycles during functional turnover are still contentious. In this\{,\} the first of several planned parts\{,\} we examine a broad range of published data relating to this question\{,\} while considering the recent atomic resolution PS II crystal structure of Umena et al.

The intention is to survey the extent to which these data yield a consistent picture of the Mn oxidation states in functional PS II - in particular\{,\} to test their consistency with two current proposals for the mean redox levels of the OEC during turnover; the so called \{'\}high\{'\} and \{'\}low\{'\} oxidation state paradigms.

The set includes ten models based on the \{'\}fused twist\{'\} core topology derived by polarized EXAFS spectra and two related models proposed in recent mechanistic investigations. Optimized geometries and spin population analyses suggest that Mn(iii)\{,\} which is most often identified with the manganese ion at site D\{,\} is always associated with a penta-coordinate environment\{,\} unless a chloride is directly ligated to the metal. Exchange coupling constants were determined by broken-symmetry density functional theory calculations and the complete spectrum of magnetic sublevels was obtained by direct diagonalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Seven models display a doublet ground state and are considered spectroscopic models for the ground state corresponding to the multiline signal (MLS) of the S2 state of the OEC\{,\} whereas the remaining five models display a sextet ground state and could be related to the g = 4.1 signal of the S2 state. It is found that the sign of the exchange coupling constant between the Mn centres at positions A and B of the cluster is directly related to the ground state multiplicity\{,\} implying that interconversion between the doublet and sextet can be induced by only small structural perturbations. The recently proposed quantum chemical method for the calculation of 55Mn hyperfine coupling constants is subsequently applied to the S2 MLS state models and the quantities that enter into the individual steps of the procedure (site-spin expectation values\{,\} intrinsic site isotropic hyperfine parameters and projected 55Mn isotropic hyperfine constants) are analyzed and discussed in detail with respect to the structural and electronic features of each model. The current approach performs promisingly. It reacts sensitively to structural distortions and hence may be able to distinguish between different structural proposals. Thus it emerges as a useful contributor to the ongoing efforts that aim at establishing correlations between the body of spectroscopic data available for the various Si states of the OEC and their actual geometric features.}

  abstract = {The sunlight-powered oxidation of water by photosystem II (PSII) of algae, plants, and cyanobacteria underpins the energy conversion processes that sustain most life on our planet. Understanding the structure and function of the ``engine of life'', the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in the active site of PSII, has been one of the great and persistent challenges of modern science. Immense progress has been achieved in recent years through combined contributions of diverse disciplines and research approaches, yet the challenge remains. The improved understanding of the tetramanganese--calcium cluster of the OEC for the experimentally accessible catalytic states often creates a more complex picture of the system than previously imagined, while the various strands of evidence cannot always be unified into a coherent model. This review focuses on selected current problems that relate to structural--electronic features of the OEC, emphasizing conceptual aspects and highlighting topics of structure and function that remain uncertain or controversial. The Mn4CaOx cluster of the OEC cycles through five redox states (S0--S4) to store the oxidizing equivalents required for the final step of dioxygen evolution in the spontaneously decaying S4 state. Remarkably, even the dark-stable state of the OEC, the S1 state, is still incompletely understood because the available structural models do not fully explain the complexity revealed by spectroscopic investigations. In addition to the nature of the dioxygen-evolving S4 state and the precise mechanism of O--O bond formation, major current open questions include the type and role of structural heterogeneity in various intermediate states of the OEC, the sequence of events in the highly complex S2--S3 transition, the heterogeneous nature of the S3 state, the accessibility of substrate or substrate analogues, the identification of substrate oxygen atoms, and the role of the protein matrix in mediating proton removal and substrate delivery. These open questions and their implications for understanding the principles of catalytic control in the OEC must be convincingly addressed before biological water oxidation can be understood in its full complexity on both the atomic and systemic levels.}

Only one energetically accessible form is found for the oxidized ``S2 state'' of the complex.

Calculations are performed by using both the symmetry-restricted and symmetry-unrestricted molecular orbitals. To facilitate computation with high accuracy, a special curve-fitting technique is presented. With the Kohn--Sham exchange-only functional, our results are generally in good agreement with those of multiconfiguration self-consistent-field (MCSCF) calculations for the three excited states, but our calculated dissociation energy for the ground state is much lower than the MCSCF and experimental values. Inclusion of the correlation term in the density functional is found to bring the ground-state dissociation energy very close to the experimental value but has little effect on the dissociation energy of the three excited states. Based on an analysis from the standpoint of orbital charge removal energy in a manner similar to the Koopmans theorem in Hartree--Fock theory, the canonical orbitals for SIC-LSD theory are introduced and their physical significance discussed.}

  abstract = {Some fundamental issues in ground-state density functional theory are discussed without equations: (1) The standard Hohenberg-Kohn and Kohn-Sham theorems were proven for a Hamiltonian that is not quite exact for real atoms, molecules, and solids. (2) The density functional for the exchange-correlation energy, which must be approximated, arises from the tendency of electrons to avoid one another as they move through the electron density. (3) In the absence of a magnetic field, either spin densities or total electron density can be used, although the former choice is better for approximations. (4) ``Spin contamination'' of the determinant of Kohn-Sham orbitals for an open-shell system is not wrong but right. (5) Only to the extent that symmetries of the interacting wave function are reflected in the spin densities should those symmetries be respected by the Kohn-Sham noninteracting or determinantal wave function. Functionals below the highest level of approximations should however sometimes break even those symmetries, for good physical reasons. (6) Simple and commonly used semilocal (lower-level) approximations for the exchange-correlation energy as a functional of the density can be accurate for closed systems near equilibrium and yet fail for open systems of fluctuating electron number. (7) The exact Kohn-Sham noninteracting state need not be a single determinant, but common approximations can fail when it is not. (8) Over an open system of fluctuating electron number, connected to another such system by stretched bonds, semilocal approximations make the exchange-correlation energy and hole-density sum rule too negative. (9) The gap in the exact Kohn-Sham band structure of a crystal underestimates the real fundamental gap but may approximate the first exciton energy in the large-gap limit. (10) Density functional theory is not really a mean-field theory, although it looks like one. The exact functional includes strong correlation, and semilocal approximations often overestimate the strength of static correlation through their semilocal exchange contributions. (11) Only under rare conditions can excited states arise directly from a ground-state theory.}

However, the gap in the band structure of the exact multiplicative Kohn-Sham (KS) potential substantially underestimates the fundamental gap, a major limitation of KS densityfunctional theory. Here, we give a simple proof of a theorem: In generalized KS theory (GKS), the band gap of an extended system equals the fundamental gap for the approximate functional if the GKS potential operator is continuous and the density change is delocalized when an electron or hole is added. Our theorem explains how GKS band gaps from metageneralized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) and hybrid functionals can be more realistic than those from GGAs or even from the exact KS potential. The theorem also follows from earlier work. The band edges in the GKS one-electron spectrum are also related to measurable energies. A linear chain of hydrogen molecules, solid aluminum arsenide, and solid argon provide numerical illustrations.},

  abstract = {The fundamental energy gap of a periodic solid distinguishes insulators from metals and characterizes low-energy single-electron excitations. However, the gap in the band structure of the exact multiplicative Kohn--Sham (KS) potential substantially underestimates the fundamental gap, a major limitation of KS density-functional theory. Here, we give a simple proof of a theorem: In generalized KS theory (GKS), the band gap of an extended system equals the fundamental gap for the approximate functional if the GKS potential operator is continuous and the density change is delocalized when an electron or hole is added. Our theorem explains how GKS band gaps from metageneralized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) and hybrid functionals can be more realistic than those from GGAs or even from the exact KS potential. The theorem also follows from earlier work. The band edges in the GKS one-electron spectrum are also related to measurable energies. A linear chain of hydrogen molecules, solid aluminum arsenide, and solid argon provide numerical illustrations.},

  abstract = {Rapid progress has been made in the last five years towards resolution of the structure of nature's water splitting catalyst --- a Mn4O5Ca cofactor embedded in Photosystem II --- especially in the field of X-ray crystallography. In addition, recent magnetic resonance data have allowed the structure of the cofactor to be accessed in its last metastable intermediate state, prior to O--O bond formation. This activated form of the catalyst is geometrically similar to that seen by X-ray crystallography, which represents the resting state of the cofactor, but requires the coordination of an additional water molecule to the cofactor, rendering all Mn ions six coordinate. Importantly, it locates two water derived, Mn bound oxygen ligands in close proximity. It is these two oxygen ligands that likely form the product O2 molecule, as proposed earlier by quantum chemical modeling. Current views on the molecular level events that facilitate catalyst activation, that is, catalyst/substrate deprotonation, Mn oxidation and water molecule insertion are briefly described.}

In particular, we present various approaches to develop approximate density matrix functionals which have been employed in RDMFT. We discuss the properties and performance of most available density matrix functionals. Progress in the development of functionals has been paralleled by formulation of novel RDMFT-based methods for predicting properties of molecular systems and solids. We give an overview of these methods. The time-dependent extension, TD-RDMFT, is a relatively new theory still awaiting practical and generally useful functionals which would work within the adiabatic approximation. In this chapter we concentrate on the formulation of TD-RDMFT response equations and various adiabatic approximations. None of the adiabatic approximations is fully satisfactory, so we also discuss a phase-dependent extension to TD-RDMFT employing the concept of phase-including-natural-spinorbitals (PINOs). We focus on applications of the linear response formulations to two-electron systems, for which the (almost) exact functional is known.},

Such interactions may account for the lengthening of the Mn-Mn distances observed in the most recent and highest resolution (1.9 A) crystal structure of PS II compared to earlier\{,\} lower-resolution (2.9 A or greater) XRD structures and EXAFS studies on functional PS II. Density functional theory is used to examine the influence on Mn-Mn distances of H-bonding interactions\{,\} mediated by the proximate His337 residue\{,\} which may lead to either partial or complete protonation of the [small mu ]3-oxo bridge on models of the WOC. Calculations were performed on a set of minimal-complexity models (in which WOC-ligating amino acid residues are represented as formate and imidazole ligands)\{,\} and also on extended models in which a 13-peptide sequence (from His332 to Ala344) is treated explicitly. These calculations demonstrate that while the 2.9 A structure is best described by models in which the [small mu ]3-oxo bridge is neither protonated nor involved in significant H-bonding\{,\} the 1.9 A XRD structure is better reproduced by models in which the [small mu ]3-oxo bridge undergoes H-bonding interactions with the His337 residue leading to expansion of the \{'\}close\{'\} Mn-Mn distances well known from EXAFS studies at [similar] 2.7 A. Furthermore\{,\} full [small mu ]3-oxo-bridge protonation remains a distinct possibility during the process of water oxidation\{,\} as evidenced by the lengthening of the Mn-Mn vectors observed in EXAFS studies of the higher oxidation states of PS II.

In this paper, we expand our previous work and show that this bias could be partly removed with a combined CASPT2/CC approach: using high-quality CASPT2 with extensive correlation-consistent basis sets for valence correlation and low-cost CCSD(T) calculations with minimal basis sets for the metal semicore (3s3p) correlation effects.

The constrained space orbital variations (CSOV) approach has also been used. Density functional theory (DFT) and CASSCF calculations have been carried out on several models of tyrosinase such as the sole Cu2O22+ central core, the Cu2O2(NH3)62+ complex and the Cu2O2(Imidazol)62+ complex. The influence on the central Cu2O2 moiety of both levels of calculation and ligand environment have been discussed. The distinct bonding modes have been characterized for the two major known structures: [Cu2({$\mu$}--{$\eta$}2: {$\eta$}2--O2)]2+ and [Cu2({$\mu$}--O2)]2+. Particular attention has been given to the analysis of the O--O and Cu--O bonds and the nature of the bonding modes has also been analyzed in terms of mesomeric structures. The ELF topological approach shows a significant conservation of the topology between the DFT and CASSCF approaches. Particularly, three-center Cu--O--Cu bonds are observed when the ligands are attached to the central core. At the DFT level, the importance of self interaction effects are emphasized. Although, the DFT approach does not appear to be suitable for the computation of the electronic structure of the isolated Cu2O2 central core, competitive self interaction mechanisms lead to an imperfect but acceptable model when using imidazol ligands. Our results confirm to a certain extent the observations of [M.F. Rode, H.J.

The role of the redox-inactive ion in the cluster has not yet been fully clarified, although several experimental data are available on Ca2+-depleted and Ca2+-substituted PSII complexes, indicating Sr2+-substituted PSII as the only modification that preserves oxygen evolution. In this work, we investigated the structural and electronic properties of the PSII catalytic core with Ca2+ replaced with Sr2+ and Cd2+ in the S2 state of the Kok-Joliot cycle by means of density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics based on a quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics approach. Our calculations do not reveal significant differences between the substituted and wild-type systems in terms of geometries, thermodynamics, and kinetics of two previously identified intermediate states along the S2 to S3 transition, namely, the open cubane S2 A and closed cubane S2 B conformers. Conversely, our calculations show different pKa values for the water molecule bound to the three investigated heterocations. Specifically, for Cd-substituted PSII, the pKa value is 5.3 units smaller than the respective value in wild type Ca-PSII. On the basis of our results, we conclude that, assuming all the cations sharing the same binding site, the induced difference in the acidity of the binding pocket might influence the hydrogen bonding network and the redox levels to prevent the further evolution of the cycle toward the S3 state.}

Thanks to the exponential localization of the Wannier functions obtained, very high accuracy in the Brillouin zone integrals can be achieved with very moderate computational costs. Moreover, the analytical expression for the band derivatives in the Wannier basis resolves any issues that may occur when evaluating derivatives near band crossings.

  abstract = {Wannier90 is an open-source computer program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) from a set of Bloch states. It is interfaced to many widely used electronic-structure codes thanks to its independence from the basis sets representing these Bloch states. In the past few years the development of Wannier90 has transitioned to a community-driven model; this has resulted in a number of new developments that have been recently released in Wannier90 v3.0. In this article we describe these new functionalities, that include the implementation of new features for wannierisation and disentanglement (symmetry-adapted Wannier functions, selectively-localised Wannier functions, selected columns of the density matrix) and the ability to calculate new properties (shift currents and Berry-curvature dipole, and a new interface to many-body perturbation theory); performance improvements, including parallelisation of the core code; enhancements in functionality (support for spinor-valued Wannier functions, more accurate methods to interpolate quantities in the Brillouin zone); improved usability (improved plotting routines, integration with high-throughput automation frameworks), as well as the implementation of modern software engineering practices (unit testing, continuous integration, and automatic source-code documentation). These new features, capabilities, and code development model aim to further sustain and expand the community uptake and range of applicability, that nowadays spans complex and accurate dielectric, electronic, magnetic, optical, topological and transport properties of materials.},

Adopting these criteria we obtain curated pseudopotential libraries (named SSSP or standard solid-state pseudopotential libraries), that we target for high-throughput materials screening (``SSSP efficiency'') and high-precision materials modelling (``SSSP precision''). This latter scores highest among open-source pseudopotential libraries available in the {$\Delta$}-factor test of equations of states of elemental solids.},

  abstract = {The charge delocalization error, besides nondynamic correlation, has been a major challenge to density functional theory. Contemporary functionals undershoot the dissociation of symmetric charged dimers A2+, a simple but stringent test, predict a spurious barrier, and improperly delocalize charges for charged molecular clusters. We extend a functional designed for nondynamic correlation to treat the charge delocalization error by modifying the nondynamic correlation for parallel spins. The modified functional eliminates those problems and reduces the multielectron self-interaction error. Furthermore, its results are the closest to those of CCSD(T) in the whole range of the dissociation compared with contemporary functionals. It correctly localizes the net positive charge in (CH4)n+ clusters and predicts a nearly constant ionization potential as a result. Testing of the SIE4x4 set shows that the new functional outperforms a wide variety of functionals assessed for this set in the literature. Overall, we show the feasibility of treating charge delocalization together with nondynamic correlation.}

The results are in good agreement with density functional calculations.}

Before comparing our ARPES simulations with available experimental data, we discuss how typical approximations for the exchange-correlation energy affect orbital energies. In particular, we show that by employing a hybrid functional, considerable improvement can be obtained over semi-local functionals in terms of band widths and relative energies of {$\pi$} and {$\sigma$} states. Our ARPES simulations for graphene show that the plane wave final state approximation provides indeed an excellent description when compared to experimental band maps and constant binding energy maps. Furthermore, our ARPES simulations for a number of polycyclic aromatic molecules from the oligo-acene, oligo-phenylene, phen-anthrene families as well as for disc-shaped molecules nicely illustrate the evolution of the electronic structure from molecules with increasing size towards graphene.},

Generally, one can construct MLWFs describing isolated bands (e.g. valence bands of insulators) or entangled bands (e.g. valence and conduction bands of insulators, or metals). Obtaining accurate and compact MLWFs often requires chemical intuition and trial and error, a challenging step even for experienced researchers and a roadblock for high-throughput calculations. Here, we present an automated approach, projectability-disentangled Wannier functions (PDWFs), that constructs MLWFs spanning the occupied bands and their complement for the empty states, providing a tight-binding picture of optimized atomic orbitals in crystals. Key to the algorithm is a projectability measure for each Bloch state onto atomic orbitals, determining if that state should be kept identically, discarded, or mixed into the disentanglement. We showcase the accuracy on a test set of 200 materials, and the reliability by constructing 21,737 Wannier Hamiltonians.},

For many applications, it is required to use MLWFs that describe instead certain target groups of bands: the valence or the conduction bands, or correlated manifolds. Here, we start from these tight-binding sets of MLWFs, and mix them using a combination of parallel transport and maximal localization to construct manifold-remixed Wannier functions (MRWFs): these are orthogonal sets of MLWFs that fully and only span desired target submanifolds. The algorithm is simple and robust, and is showcased here in reference applications (silicon, MoS2, and SrVO3) and in a mid-throughput study of 77 insulators.},

However, the poor stability of CsSnX3 perovskites has so far prevented the fabrication of devices that can withstand sustained operation under normal conditions. In this paper, a two-step sequential deposition method is developed to grow high-quality B-{$\gamma$}-CsSnI3 thin films and their unique phase change in atmosphere is explored in detail. We find the spontaneous oxidative conversion from unstable B-{$\gamma$}-CsSnI3 to air-stable Cs2SnI6 in air. Allowing the phase conversion of the CsSnI3 film to evolve in ambient air it gives the semiconducting perovskite Cs2SnI6 with a bandgap of 1.48eV and high absorption coefficient (over 105cm-1 from 1.7eV). More importantly, the Cs2SnI6 film, for the first time, is adopted as a light absorber layer for a lead-free perovskite solar cell and a preliminary estimate of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) about 1\% with open-circuit voltage of 0.51V and short-circuit current of 5.41mA/cm2 is realized by optimizing the perovskite absorber thickness. According to the bandgap and the Shockley-Queisser limit, such inorganic perovskite solar cell with higher efficiency and pronounced stability can be expected by material quality improvement and device engineering.},

Our theory, which is based on a different accounting of energy functional terms, partially solves one well-known downside of conventional Kohn--Sham (KS) DFT: that electronic energies have but tenuous connections to physical quantities. Calculated average electron energies are close to experimental ionization potentials (IPs) in one-electron systems, demonstrating a surprisingly small effect of self-interaction and other exchange-correlation errors in established DFT methods. Remarkable agreement with ab initio quantum mechanical calculations of multielectron systems is demonstrated using several flavors of DFT, and we argue for the use of the average electron energy as a design criterion for density functional approximations.}

  abstract = {We apply an Ising-type model to estimate the bandgaps of the polytypes of group IV elements (C, Si, and Ge) and binary compounds of groups: IV--IV (SiC, GeC, and GeSi), and III--V (nitride, phosphide, and arsenide of B, Al, and Ga). The models use reference bandgaps of the simplest polytypes comprising 2--6 bilayers calculated with the hybrid density functional approximation, HSE06. We report four models capable of estimating bandgaps of nine polytypes containing 7 and 8 bilayers with an average error of {$\lessequivlnt$}0.05~eV. We apply the best model with an error of \&lt;0.04 eV to predict the bandgaps of 497 polytypes with up to 15 bilayers in the unit cell, providing a comprehensive view of the variation in the electronic structure with the degree of hexagonality of the crystal structure. Within our enumeration, we identify four rhombohedral polytypes of SiC---9R, 12R, 15R(1), and 15R(2)---and perform detailed stability and band structure analysis. Of these, 15R(1) that has not been experimentally characterized has the widest bandgap (\&gt;3.4 eV); phonon analysis and cohesive energy reveal 15R(1)-SiC to be metastable. Additionally, we model the energies of valence and conduction bands of the rhombohedral SiC phases at the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and predict band structure characteristics around the Fermi level. The models presented in this study may aid in identifying polytypic phases suitable for various applications, such as the design of wide-gap materials, that are relevant to high-voltage applications. In particular, the method holds promise for forecasting electronic properties of long-period and ultra-long-period polytypes for which accurate first-principles modeling is computationally challenging.}

  abstract = {Modeling polaron defects is an important aspect of computational materials science, but the description of unpaired spins in density functional theory (DFT) often suffers from delocalization error. To diagnose and correct the overdelocalization of spin defects, we report an implementation of density-corrected (DC-)DFT and its analytic energy gradient. In DC-DFT, an exchange-correlation functional is evaluated using a Hartree--Fock density, thus incorporating electron correlation while avoiding self-interaction error. Results for an electron polaron in models of titania and a hole polaron in Al-doped silica demonstrate that geometry optimization with semilocal functionals drives significant structural distortion, including the elongation of several bonds, such that subsequent single-point calculations with hybrid functionals fail to afford a localized defect even in cases where geometry optimization with the hybrid functional does localize the polaron. This has significant implications for traditional workflows in computational materials science, where semilocal functionals are often used for structure relaxation. DC-DFT calculations provide a mechanism to detect situations where delocalization error is likely to affect the results.}

  abstract = {Ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation is a Green's function formalism widely used in the calculation of quasiparticle excitation energies of solids. In what has become an increasingly standard approach, Kohn--Sham eigenenergies, generated from a DFT calculation with a strategically-chosen exchange--correlation functional ``starting point'', are used to construct G and W, and then perturbatively corrected by the resultant GW self-energy. In practice, there are several ways to construct the GW self-energy, and these can lead to variations in predicted quasiparticle energies. For example, for ZnO and TiO2, the GW fundamental gaps reported in the literature can vary by more than 1 eV depending on the GW code used. In this work, we calculate and analyze GW quasiparticle (QP) energies of these and other systems with three different GW codes: BerkeleyGW, Abinit and Yambo. Through a systematic analysis of the GW implementation of these three codes, we identify the primary origin of major discrepancies between codes reported in prior literature to be the different implementations the Coulomb divergence in the Fock exchange term and the frequency integration scheme of the GW self-energy. We then eliminate these discrepancies by using common numerical methods and algorithms, demonstrating that the same quasiparticle energies for a given material can be obtained with different codes, within numerical differences ascribable to the technical details of the underling implementations. This work will be important for users and developers in assessing the precision of future GW applications and methods.},

  abstract = {Many observables such as the density, total energy, or electric current, can be expressed explicitly in terms of the one-body Green's function, which describes electron addition or removal to or from a system. An efficient way to determine such a Green's function is to introduce a self-energy, which is a nonlocal and dynamic effective potential that influences the propagation of particles in an interacting system. The state-of-the art approximation for the self-energy is the GW approximation, where the system to (or from) which the electron is added (or removed) is described as a polarizable, screening, medium. This is expressed by the name of the approximation: `GW' stands for the one-body Green's function G and for W, the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction. The GW approximation is very popular for the calculation of band structures in solids, and increasingly used also to describe nanostructures, clusters, and molecules. As compared to static mean-field approximations for the effective potential, the dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction in GW leads to a renormalization of energies, to broadening and/or to the observation of additional excitations. An analysis of the approximations that lead to the GW self-energy, and of the underlying picture, explains the successes and the limitations of the approach.

In its original formulation, the polaron problem considers a single charge carrier in a polar crystal interacting with its surrounding lattice.

This chapter discusses the modeling of small polarons in real materials, with a particular focus on the archetypal polaron material TiO2. After an introductory part, surveying the fundamental theoretical and experimental aspects of the physics of polarons, the chapter examines how to model small polarons using first-principles schemes in order to predict, understand, and interpret a variety of polaron properties in bulk phases and surfaces. Following the spirit of this handbook, different types of computational procedures and prescriptions are presented with specific instructions on the setup required to model polaron effects.},

For defective systems, \$U\$ changes as a function of the distance of the Hubbard site from the defect, its oxidation state and the magnetic phase of the bulk structure.

Our results demonstrate that the extended Hubbard functional is a promising approach to study defects in materials with electronic properties similar to STO. Indeed, DFT+{$U$}+{$V$} provides a better description of stoichiometric STO compared to standard DFT or DFT+{$U$}, the band gap and crystal field splitting being in good agreement with experiments. In turn, also the description of the electronic properties of oxygen vacancies in STO is improved, with formation energies in excellent agreement with experiments as well as results obtained with the most frequently used hybrid functionals, however, at a fraction of the computational cost. While our results do not fully resolve the contradictory findings reported in literature, our systematic approach leads to a deeper understanding of their origin, which stems from different cell sizes, STO phases, the exchange-correlation functional, and the treatment of structural relaxations and spin-polarization.}

We demonstrate that, unlike methods using only the one-body Green's function, our approach puts the description of quasiparticles and satellites on an equal footing. We propose a multichannel self-energy that is static and only contains the bare Coulomb interaction, making frequency convolutions and self-consistency unnecessary. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate with a diagrammatic analysis that the physics it describes is extremely rich. Finally, we present a framework based on an effective Hamiltonian that can be solved for any many-body system using standard numerical tools. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Hubbard dimer and show that it is exact both at 1/4 and 1/2 filling.}

  abstract = {A density matrix formulation of the super-CI MCSCF method is presented. The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space, and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary group approach. With a density matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes independent of the size of the CI expansion. It is possible to formulate the super-CI in terms of density matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter. Further, in the unitary group formalism it is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary density matrices from the symbolic formula list. It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so far comprising 726 configurations. The method is demonstrated in a calculation of the potential curves for the three lowest states (1{$\Sigma$}+g, 3{$\Sigma$}+u and 3{$\Pi$}g) of the N2 molecule, using a medium-sized gaussian basis set. Seven active orbitals were used yielding the following results: De: 8.76 (9.90), 2.43 (3.68) and 3.39 (4.90) eV; re: 1.108 (1.098), 1.309 (1.287) and 1.230 (1.213) \AA; {$\omega$}e: 2333 (2359), 1385 (1461) and 1680 (1733) cm-1, for the three states (experimental values within parentheses). The results of these calculations indicate that it is important to consider not only the dissociation limit but also the united atom limit in partitioning the occupied orbital space into an active and an inactive part.}

  abstract = {State-of-the-art methods for calculating neutral excitation energies are typically demanding and limited to single electron-hole pairs and their composite plasmons. Here we introduce excitonic density-functional theory (XDFT) a computationally light, generally applicable, first-principles technique for calculating neutral excitations based on generalized constrained DFT. In order to simulate an M-particle excited state of an N-electron system, XDFT automatically optimizes a constraining potential to confine N-M electrons within the ground-state Kohn-Sham valence subspace. We demonstrate the efficacy of XDFT by calculating the lowest single-particle singlet and triplet excitation energies of the well-known Thiel molecular test set, with results which are in excellent agreement with time-dependent DFT. Furthermore, going beyond the capability of adiabatic time-dependent DFT, we show that XDFT can successfully capture double excitations. Overall our method makes optical gaps, excition bindings and oscillator strengths readily accessible at a computational cost comparable to that of standard DFT. As such, XDFT appears as an ideal candidate to work within high-throughput discovery frameworks and within linear-scaling methods for large systems.},

  abstract = {In situ optimization of a set of localized orbitals with respect to a systematically improvable basis set independent of the position of the atoms, such as psinc functions, would theoretically eliminate the correction due to Pulay forces from the total ionic forces. We demonstrate that for strict localization constraints, especially with small localization regions, there can be non-negligible Pulay forces that must be calculated as a correction to the Hellmann-Feynman forces in the ground state. Geometry optimization calculations, which rely heavily upon accurate evaluation of the total ionic forces, show much better convergence when Pulay forces are included. The more conventional case, where the local orbitals remain fixed to pseudo-atomic orbital multiple-{$\zeta$} basis sets, also benefits from this implementation. We have validated the method on several test cases, including a DNA fragment with 1045 atoms.}

For example, NaCl can dissociate to  Na +0.4 {$\cdots$} Cl -0.4 Na+0.4{$\cdots$}Cl-0.4 .

The original SIC of Perdew and Zunger typically reduces  {$q$} q  to 0. A scaled-down SIC with better equilibrium properties sometimes fails to reduce  {$q$} q  all the way to 0.

An `` {$M$} M -electron self-interaction-free'' functional for positive integer  {$M$} M  is one that produces a realistic linear variation of total energy with  {$N$} N  in the range of  {$M-$}1{$<N\leqM$} M-1{$<$}N{$\leq$}M , and so can avoid these errors. This desideratum is a natural generalization to all  {$M$} M  of the more familiar one of one-electron self-interaction freedom. The intent of this paper is not to advocate for any functional, but to understand what is required for a functional to be  {$M$} M -electron self-interaction-free and thus correct even for highly stretched bonds. The original Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction (SIC) and our scaled-down variant of it are exactly one- and nearly two-electron self-interaction-free, but only the former is nearly so for atoms with  {$M>$}2 M{$>$}2 . Thus all these SIC's produce an exact binding energy curve for  H + 2 H2+ , and an accurate one for  He + 2 He2+ , but only the unscaled Perdew-Zunger SIC produces an accurate one for  Ne + 2 Ne2+ , where there are more than two electrons on each fragment  Ne +0.5 Ne+0.5 . We also discuss  Li H + LiH+ , which is relatively free from self-interaction errors. We suggest that the ability of the original and unscaled Perdew-Zunger SIC to be nearly  {$M$} M -electron self-interaction-free for atoms of all  {$M$} M  stems in part from its formal resemblance to the Hartree-Fock theory, with which it shares a sum rule on the exchange-correlation hole of an open system.}

From 290 to 380 K, the computed band gap change of 40 meV coincides with the experimental change of 30-40 meV. The calculation of electron-phonon coupling in CH3NH3PbI3 is particularly intricate as the commonly used Allen-Heine-Cardona theory overestimates the band gap change with temperature, and excellent agreement with experiment is only obtained when including high-order terms in the electron-phonon interaction. We also find that spin-orbit coupling enhances the electron-phonon coupling strength but that the inclusion of nonlocal correlations using hybrid functionals has little effect. We reach similar conclusions in the metal-halide perovskite CsPbI3. Our results unambiguously confirm for the first time the importance of high-order terms in the electron-phonon coupling by direct comparison with experiment.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic water oxidation performed at the Mn4CaO5 cluster in photosystem II plays a crucial role in energy production as electron and proton sources necessary for CO2 fixation. Molecular oxygen, a byproduct, is a source of the oxygenic atmosphere that sustains life on earth. However, the molecular mechanism of water oxidation is not yet well- understood. In the reaction cycle of intermediates called S states, the S2{$\rightarrow$}S3 transition is particularly important; it consists of multiple processes of electron transfer, proton release, and water insertion, and generates an intermediate leading to O-O bond formation. In this study, we monitored the reaction process during the S2 {$\rightarrow$} S3 transition using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy to clarify its molecular mechanism. A change in the hydrogen-bond interaction of the oxidized YZ {$\bullet$} radical, an immediate electron acceptor of the Mn4CaO5 cluster, was clearly observed as a {$\sim$}100 {$\mu$}s phase before the electron-transfer phase with a time constant of {$\sim$}350 {$\mu$}s. This observation provides strong experimental evidence that rearrangement of the hydrogen-bond network around YZ {$\bullet$}, possibly due to the movement of a water molecule located near YZ {$\bullet$} to the Mn site, takes place before the electron transfer. The electron transfer was coupled with proton release, as revealed by a relatively high deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 1.9. This proton release, which decreases the redox potential of the Mn4CaO5 cluster to facilitate electron transfer to YZ {$\bullet$}, was proposed to determine, as a rate- limiting step, the relatively slow electron-transfer rate of the S2 {$\rightarrow$} S3 transition.}

  abstract = {Recent discoveries of new materials for thermoelectric energy conversion are enabled by efficient prediction of the materials' performance from first-principles, without empirically fitted parameters. The novel simplified approach for computing electronic transport properties is described, which achieves good accuracy and transferability while greatly reducing complexity and computation cost compared to the existing methods. The first-principles calculations of the electron--phonon coupling demonstrate that the energy dependence of the electron relaxation time varies significantly with chemical composition and carrier concentration, suggesting that it is necessary to go beyond the commonly used approximations to screen and optimize materials' composition, carrier concentration, and microstructure. The new method is verified using high accuracy computations and validated with experimental data before applying it to screen and discover promising compositions in the space of half-Heusler alloys. By analyzing data trends the effective electron mass is identified as the single best general descriptor determining material' performance. The Lorenz number is computed from first principles and the universality of the Wiedemann--Franz law in thermoelectrics is discussed.},

  abstract = {Semilocal density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy of a many-electron system cannot be exact for all one-electron densities. In 1981, Perdew and Zunger (PZ) subtracted the fully nonlocal self-interaction error orbital-by-orbital, making the corrected functional exact for all collections of separated one-electron densities and making no correction to the exact functional. Although the PZ self-interaction correction (SIC) eliminates many errors of semilocal functionals, it is often worse for equilibrium properties of sp-bonded molecules and solids. Nonempirical semilocal functionals are usually designed to be exact for electron gases of uniform density and, thus, also make 0\% error for neutral atoms in the limit of large atomic number Z, but PZ SIC is not so designed. For localized SIC orbitals, we show analytically that the local spin density approximation (LSDA)-SIC correlation energy per electron of the uniform gas in the high-density limit makes an error of -50\% in the spin-unpolarized case and -100\% in the fully spin-polarized case. Then we extrapolate from the Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms to estimate the relative errors of the PZ SIC exchange-correlation energies (with localized SIC orbitals) in the limit of large atomic number: about +5.5\% for the LSDA-SIC and about -3.5\% for nonempirical generalized gradient [Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)-SIC] and meta-generalized gradient strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN)-SIC approximations. The SIC errors are considerably larger than those that have been estimated for LSDA-SIC by approximating the localized SIC orbitals for the uniform gas and may explain the errors of PZ SIC for equilibrium properties, opening the door to a generalized SIC that is more widely accurate.}

Plutonium undergoes a 25 per cent increase in volume4 when transformed from its {$\alpha$}-phase (which is stable below 400\,K) to the {$\delta$}-phase (stable at around 600\,K), an effect that is crucial for issues of long-term storage and disposal. It has long been suspected that this unique property is a consequence of the special location of plutonium in the periodic table, on the border between the light and heavy actinides---here, electron wave--particle duality (or itinerant versus localized behaviour) is important5. This situation has resisted previous theoretical treatment. Here we report an electronic structure method, based on dynamical mean-field theory, that enables interpolation between the band-like and atomic-like behaviour of the electron. Our approach enables us to study the phase diagram of plutonium, by providing access to the energetics and one-electron spectra of strongly correlated systems. We explain the origin of the volume expansion between the {$\alpha$}- and {$\delta$}-phases, predict the existence of a strong quasiparticle peak near the Fermi level and give a new viewpoint on the physics of plutonium, in which the {$\alpha$}- and {$\delta$}-phases are on opposite sides of the interaction-driven localization--delocalization transition.},

We demonstrate that while SR calculations have higher random errors, FR calculations systematically underestimate the VIP by 0.1 to 0.2 eV. We further verify that SOC effects may be well approximated at the FR density functional level and then added to SR G0W0 results for a broad class of systems. We also address the use of different root-finding algorithms for the G0W0 quasiparticle equation and the significant influence of including d electrons in the valence partition of the pseudopotential for G0W0 calculations. Finally, we present statistical analyses of our data, highlighting the importance of separating definitive improvements from those that may occur by chance due to a limited number of samples. We suggest the statistical analyses used here will be useful in the assessment of the accuracy of a large variety of electronic structure methods.}

In this paper we obtain a rigorous, simple relation whose fulfilment guarantees particle-number conservation in a given diagrammatic self-energy approximation. Hedin's G0W0 approximation does not satisfy this relation and hence violates the particle-number sum rule. Very precise calculations for the homogeneous electron gas and a model inhomogeneous electron system allow the extent of the nonconservation to be estimated.}

Extreme temperature and pressure conditions accelerate peptidization greatly compared to the ambient bulk water environment and are shown to favor, in general, concerted versus stepwise mechanisms.

Particular emphasis is set on the catalytic effects of the mineral surface including the putative role of the ubiquitous sulfur vacancy defects. It is found that the mere presence of a surface is able to change the free energetics of the elementary reaction steps. This effect can be understood in terms of a reduction of entropic contributions to the reactant state by immobilizing the reactants and/or screening them from bulk water in a purely geometric (``steric'') sense. Additionally, the pyrite directly participates chemically in some of the reaction steps, thus changing the reaction mechanism qualitatively compared to the situation in bulk water. First, the adsorption of reactants on the surface can preform a product-like structure due to immobilizing and scaffolding them appropriately. Second, pyrite can act as a proton acceptor, thus replacing water in this role. Third, sulfur vacancies are found to increase the reactivity of the surface. The finding that the presence of pyrite speeds up the rate-determining step in the formation of peptides with respect to the situation in bulk solvent while stabilizing the produced peptide against hydrolysis is of particular interest to the hypothesis of prebiotic peptide formation at hydrothermal aqueous conditions. Apart from these implications, the generality of the studied organic reactions are of immediate relevance to many fields such as (bio)geochemistry, biomineralization, and environmental chemistry.}

The success of these functionals relies on capturing the effects of electronic screening through scalar, orbital-dependent parameters. These parameters have to be computed for every calculation, making Koopmans spectral functionals more expensive than their DFT counterparts. In this work, we present a machine-learning model that -- with minimal training -- can predict these screening parameters directly from orbital densities calculated at the DFT level. We show on two prototypical use cases that using the screening parameters predicted by this model, instead of those calculated from linear response, leads to orbital energies that differ by less than 20 meV on average. Since this approach dramatically reduces run-times with minimal loss of accuracy, it will enable the application of Koopmans spectral functionals to classes of problems that previously would have been prohibitively expensive, such as the prediction of temperature-dependent spectral properties.},

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is well suited for the investigation of Floquet physics, as it allows to directly probe the dressed electronic states of driven solids. Depending on the system, scattering and decoherence can play an important role, hampering the emergence of Floquet states. Another challenge is to disentangle Floquet side bands from laser-assisted photoemission (LAPE), since both lead to similar signatures in ARPES spectra. Here, we investigate the emergence of Floquet state in the transition metal dichalcogenide 2H-WSe2, one of the most promising systems for observing Floquet physics. We discuss how the topological Floquet state manifests in characteristic features in the circular dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions (CDAD) that is determined by the transient band structure modifications and the associated texture of the orbital angular momentum. Combining highly accurate modeling of the photoemission matrix elements with an ab initio description of the light-matter interaction, we investigate regimes which can be realized in current state-of-the-art experimental setups. The predicted features are robust against scattering effects and are expected to be observed in forthcoming experiments.},

  abstract = {The unique manganese--calcium catalyst in photosystem II (PSII) is the natural paragon for efficient light-driven water oxidation to yield O2. The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in the dark-stable state (S1) comprises a Mn4CaO4 core with five metal-bound water species. Binding and modification of the water molecules that are substrates of the water-oxidation reaction is mechanistically crucial but controversially debated. Two recent crystal structures of the OEC in its highest oxidation state (S3) show either a vacant Mn coordination site or a bound peroxide species. For purified PSII at room temperature, we collected Mn K{$\alpha$} X-ray emission spectra of the S0, S1, S2, and S3 intermediates in the OEC cycle, which were analyzed by comparison to synthetic Mn compounds, spectral simulations, and OEC models from density functional theory. Our results contrast both crystallographic structures. They indicate Mn oxidation in three S-transitions and suggest additional water binding at a previously open Mn coordination ...}

This work presents a procedure that allows to reliably determine critical parameters for engineering quantum devices; band offset, band bending profile, and number of occupied quantum well subbands of interfacial accumulation layers at semiconductor-metal interfaces. Soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission is used to directly measure the quantum well states as well as valence bands and core levels for the InAs(100)/Al interface, an important platform for Majorana-zero-mode based topological qubits, and demonstrate that the fabrication process strongly influences the band offset, which in turn controls the topological phase diagrams. Since the method is transferable to other narrow gap semiconductors, it can be used more generally for engineering semiconductor--metal and semiconductor--superconductor interfaces in gate-tunable superconducting devices.},

Herein, we report a synthetic OEC model based on a molecular manganese vanadium oxide cluster, [Mn4 V4 O17 (OAc)3 ](3-) . The compound is based on a [Mn4 O4 ](6+) cubane core, which catalyzes the homogeneous, visible-light-driven oxidation of water to molecular oxygen and is stabilized by a tripodal [V4 O13 ](6-) polyoxovanadate and three acetate ligands. When combined with the photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)3 ](2+) and the oxidant persulfate, visible-light-driven water oxidation with turnover numbers of approximately 1150 and turnover frequencies of about 1.75 s(-1) is observed. Electrochemical, mass-spectrometric, and spectroscopic studies provide insight into the cluster stability and reactivity. This compound could serve as a model for the molecular structure and reactivity of the OEC and for heterogeneous metal oxide water-oxidation catalysts.}

An active learner may ask queries in the form of unlabeled instances to be labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant but labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This report provides a general introduction to active learning and a survey of the literature. This includes a discussion of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated, and an overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and theoretical evidence for active learning, a summary of several problem setting variants, and a discussion of related topics in machine learning research are also presented.},

(ii) Both the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker calculation of Connolly and Johnson and the relativistic-augmented-plane-wave calculation by Christensen and Seraphin give density-of-states results that (after broadening) follow the experimental curve closely. (iii) Of the theoretical functions available to date, those with full Slater exchange agree best with experiment (perhaps because of a cancellation of errors). Fractional (23 or 56) exchange gives d bands that are too wide. (iv) Eastman's 40.8-eV ultraviolet photoemission spectrum is similar to the x-ray spectrum, suggesting little dependence on photon energy above 40 eV. (v) Both (ii) and (iv) imply an absence of strong matrix-element modulation in the photoemission spectrum of gold.}

It is shown that the G0W0 approximation always yields too small band gaps. To improve agreement with experiment, the eigenvalues in the Green's function G (GW0) and in the Green's function and the dielectric matrix (GW) are updated until self-consistency is reached. The first approximation leads to excellent agreement with experiment, whereas an update of the eigenvalues in G and W gives too large band gaps for virtually all materials. From a pragmatic point of view, the GW0 approximation thus seems to be an accurate and still reasonably fast method for predicting quasiparticle energies in simple sp-bonded systems. We furthermore observe that the band gaps in materials with shallow d states (GaAs, GaN, and ZnO) are systematically underestimated. We propose that an inaccurate description of the static dielectric properties of these materials is responsible for the underestimation of the band gaps in GW0, which is itself a result of the incomplete cancellation of the Hartree self-energy within the d shell by local or gradient corrected density functionals.}

In contrast to our previous studies, where redox potentials of several cathode materials have been calculated in a good agreement with experiment (e.g., NaMnO2, LiFePO4, and LiTiS2), herein, we analyze other cathode materials, such as LiNiO2 and Ni- and V-containing phosphates for which this method provides much underestimated redox voltages. We ascribe this limited predictive power of the DFT+U method, parameterized via LR, to the absence of corrections of Coulomb interactions between the electrons with opposite spins. Using the recently proposed extended DFT+U+U{$\uparrow\downarrow$} functional, which includes the aforementioned corrections, we show how redox potentials of Ni- and V-based compounds could be calculated in a much better agreement with experiment, also proposing a procedure of parameterization of such calculations. Thus, our extended method allows us to calculate redox potentials of several important materials more accurately while retaining good agreement with experiment for structures where the standard DFT+U method also accurately predicts electrochemical properties.}

It is found that the proton transfers occur in multiple steps. Structures of intermediates and energy diagrams are derived and compared to experimental observations. Since the new experimental structure of the OEC is very similar to the one suggested earlier by density functional calculations\{,\} the O-O bond formation step remains essentially the same as the one suggested five years ago. An interesting new result is that the barrier for proton transfer within the OEC actually competes with the O-O bond formation step of being rate-limiting.}

Existing interpretations of the experimental water exchange results have been quite different. By many groups, these results have been the main argument against the water oxidation mechanism suggested by DFT, in which the oxygen molecule is formed between a bridging oxo and an oxyl radical ligand in the center of the OEC. That mechanism is otherwise in line with most experiments. The problem has been that the mechanism requires a rather fast exchange of a bridging oxo ligand, which is not a common finding for smaller Mn-containing model systems. However, other groups have actually favored a substrate derived oxo ligand partly based on the same experiments. In the present study, three S-states have been studied, and the rates have been well reproduced by the calculations. The surprising experimental finding that water exchange in S1 is slower than the one in S2 is reproduced and explained. The key to this rate difference is the ease by which one of the manganese centers (Mn3) is reduced. This reduction has to occur to release the substrate water from Mn3. The similar rate of the slow exchange in S2 and S3 has been rationalized on the basis of earlier experiments combined with the present calculations. The results strongly support the previous DFT-suggested water oxidation mechanism.},

In the present short paper, the six most reasonable versions of the latter mechanism have been studied and compared with the oxo-oxyl mechanism.

Even without the correction, the PBE functional gives quite good results despite the fact that corresponding Rydberg virtual orbitals have positive energy in the ground state calculation. Results obtained using the TPSS and r2SCAN meta-GGA functionals are also presented, but they do not provide a systematic improvement over the results from the uncorrected PBE functional. The grid representation combined with the projector augmented-wave approach gives a simpler and better representation of the diffuse Rydberg orbitals than a linear combination of atomic orbitals with commonly used basis sets, the latter leading to an overestimation of the excitation energy due to confinement of the excited states.},

  abstract = {We develop a theoretical and computational framework to study polarons in semiconductors and insulators from first principles. Our approach provides the formation energy, excitation energy, and wave function of both electron and hole polarons, and takes into account the coupling of the electron or hole to all phonons. An important feature of the present method is that it does not require supercell calculations, and relies exclusively on electron band structures, phonon dispersions, and electron-phonon matrix elements obtained from calculations in the crystal unit cell. Starting from the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations of density-functional theory, we formulate the polaron problem as a variational minimization, and we obtain a nonlinear eigenvalue problem in the basis of KS states and phonon eigenmodes. In our formalism, the electronic component of the polaron is expressed as a coherent superposition of KS states, in close analogy with the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the calculation of excitons. We demonstrate the power of the methodology by studying polarons in LiF and Li2O2. We show that our method describes both small and large polarons, and seamlessly captures Fr\"ohlich-type polar electron-phonon coupling and non-Fr\"ohlich coupling to acoustic and optical phonons. To analyze in quantitative terms, the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of polarons, we introduce spectral decompositions similar to the Eliashberg spectral function. We validate our theory using both analytical results and direct calculations on large supercells. This study constitutes a first step toward complete ab initio many-body calculations of polarons in real materials.}

The Fr\"ohlich electron-phonon matrix element is by now well understood in the case of bulk three-dimensional (3D) materials. In the case of two-dimensional (2D) materials, the standard procedure to include Fr\"ohlich coupling is to employ Coulomb truncation, so as to eliminate artificial interactions between periodic images of the 2D layer. While these techniques are well established, the transition of the Fr\"ohlich coupling from three to two dimensions has not been investigated. Furthermore, it remains unclear what error one makes when describing 2D systems using the standard bulk formalism in a periodic supercell geometry. Here we generalize previous work on the ab initio Fr\"ohlich electron-phonon matrix element in bulk materials by investigating the electrostatic potential of atomic dipoles in a periodic supercell consisting of a 2D material and a continuum dielectric slab. We obtain a unified expression for the matrix element, which reduces to the existing formulas for three-dimensional and 2D systems when the interlayer separation tends to zero or infinity, respectively. This expression enables an accurate description of the Fr\"ohlich matrix element in 2D systems without resorting to Coulomb truncation. We validate our approach by direct ab initio density-functional perturbation theory calculations for monolayer BN and MoS2, and we provide a simple expression for the 2D Fr\"ohlich matrix element that can be used in model Hamiltonian approaches. The formalism outlined in this work may find applications in calculations of polarons, quasiparticle renormalization, transport coefficients, and superconductivity, in 2D and quasi-2D materials.}

Here, we shed light on this asymmetry by developing a quantitative ab initio theory of polarons in atomically thin crystals. Using this conceptual framework, we determine the real-space structure of the recently observed hole polaron in hexagonal boron nitride, discover a critical condition for the existence of polarons in two-dimensional crystals and establish the key materials descriptors and the universal laws that underpin polaron physics in two dimensions.},

  abstract = {A general approach to calculate the diabatic surfaces for electron-transfer reactions is presented, based on first-principles molecular dynamics of the active centers and their surrounding medium. The excitation energy corresponding to the transfer of an electron at any given ionic configuration (the Marcus energy gap) is accurately assessed within ground-state density-functional theory via a novel penalty functional for oxidation-reduction reactions that appropriately acts on the electronic degrees of freedom alone. The self-interaction error intrinsic to common exchange-correlation functionals is also corrected by the same penalty functional. The diabatic free-energy surfaces are then constructed from umbrella sampling on large ensembles of configurations. As a paradigmatic case study, the self-exchange reaction between ferrous and ferric ions in water is studied in detail. \copyright{} 2006 The American Physical Society.}

The exchange-correlation functional is defined in a similar manner to the PBE0 functional, but the mixing parameter is set equal to the inverse macroscopic dielectric function and it is determined self-consistently by computing the optimal dielectric screening. We found excellent agreement with experiments for the properties of a broad class of systems, with band gaps ranging between 0.7 and 21.7 eV and dielectric constants within 1.23 and 15.9.

Here we introduce a range-separated (RS) version of DDH functionals where short- and long-range components are matched using system-dependent, nonempirical parameters. We show that RS-DDHs yield accurate electronic properties of inorganic and organic solids, including energy gaps and absolute ionization potentials. Furthermore we show that these functionals may be generalized to finite systems.}

If the exact weak-interaction expansion from the second-order perturbation theory is included, a self-consistent implementation of these functionals is challenging and still absent in the literature. In this work, we fill this gap by presenting a fully self-consistent-field (SCF) implementation of some popular ACM functionals. While using second-order perturbation theory at weak interactions, we have also introduced new generalized gradient approximations (GGAs), beyond the usual point-charge-plus-continuum model, for the first two leading terms at strong interactions, which are crucial to ensure robustness and reliability. We then assess the SCF--ACM functionals for molecular systems and for prototypical strong-correlation problems. We find that they perform well for both the total energy and the electronic density and that the impact of SCF orbitals is directly connected to the accuracy of the ACM functional form. For the H2 dissociation, the SCF--ACM functionals yield significant improvements with respect to standard functionals also thanks to the use of the new GGAs for the strong-coupling functionals.}

The present scheme removes the limitation of the usual maximally localized WF's method [N. Marzari and D. Vanderbilt, Phys. Rev. B 56, 12 847 (1997)] that the bands of interest should form an isolated group, separated by gaps from higher and lower bands everywhere in the Brillouin zone. An energy window encompassing N bands of interest is specified by the user, and the algorithm then proceeds to disentangle these from the remaining bands inside the window by filtering out an optimally connected N-dimensional subspace. This is achieved by minimizing a functional that measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally localized WF's for the optimal subspace are then obtained via the algorithm of Marzari and Vanderbilt. The method, which functions as a postprocessing step using the output of conventional electronic-structure codes, is applied to the s and d bands of copper, and to the valence and low-lying conduction bands of silicon. For the low-lying nearly-free-electron bands of copper we find WF's which are centered at the tetrahedral-interstitial sites, suggesting an alternative tight-binding parametrization.}

The proposed method employs B-splines, bell-shaped spline functions with compact support, to construct each inhomogeneity correction factor (ICF). This choice offers several distinct advantages over traditional polynomial expansions by enabling explicit enforcement of linear and nonlinear constraints as well as ICF smoothness using Tikhonov and penalized B-splines (P-splines) regularization. As proof-of-concept, we use the so-called CASE (constrained and smoothed empirical) framework to construct a constraint-satisfying and data-driven global hybrid that exhibits enhanced performance across a diverse set of chemical properties. We argue that the CASE approach can be used to generate DFAs that maintain the physical rigor and transferability of NE-DFAs while leveraging high-quality quantum-mechanical data to remove the arbitrariness of ansatz selection and improve performance.}

This extends the quantitative usage of density functional theory to an area long believed to be outside its reach.}

Application to transition-metal oxides and elements with d electrons is hindered by a serious breaking of the spherical symmetry, which appears even in a closed-shell free atom.

  abstract = {Fermionic superfluidity requires the formation of particle pairs, the size of which varies depending on the system. Many properties of the superfluid depend on the pair size relative to the inter-particle spacing. For example, conventional superconductors comprise a superfluid of loosely bound, large Cooper pairs of electrons, while Bose-Einstein condensates contain tightly bound molecules. The microscopic properties of the fermion pairs can be probed with radio-frequency spectroscopy. However, previous results have been difficult to interpret due to strong final-state interactions that were not well understood. Schunck et al. realize a superfluid spin mixture in an ultracold gas of lithium atoms in which such interactions have negligible influence. They find that the spectroscopic pair size is smaller than the inter-particle spacing. These are the smallest pairs yet observed for fermionic superfluids. In a related experiment, Jin et al use a technique called photoemission spectroscopy to study the excitations in a strongly interacting gas of ultracold potassium atoms. Such studies are of interest because the physics is related to that of the high transition-temperature superconductors, which are not fully understood.},

  abstract = {Electronic phase separation is crucial for the fascinating macroscopic properties of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) paradigm oxide interface, including the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism. We investigate this phenomenon using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) in the soft-x-ray energy range, where the enhanced probing depth combined with resonant photoexcitation allow us access to fundamental electronic structure characteristics -- momentum-resolved spectral function, dispersions and ordering of energy bands, Fermi surface -- of buried interfaces. Our experiment uses x-ray irradiation of the LAO/STO interface to tune its oxygen deficiency, building up a dichotomic system where mobile weakly correlated Tit2g electrons coexist with localized strongly correlated Tieg ones. The ARPES spectra dynamics under x-ray irradiation shows a gradual intensity increase under constant Luttinger count of the Fermi surface. This fact identifies electronic phase separation (EPS) where the mobile electrons accumulate in conducting puddles with fixed electronic structure embedded in an insulating host phase, and allows us to estimate the lateral fraction of these puddles. We discuss the physics of EPS invoking a theoretical picture of oxygen-vacancy clustering, promoted by the magnetism of the localized Tieg electrons, and repelling of the mobile t2g electrons from these clusters. Our results on the irradiation-tuned EPS elucidate the intrinsic one taking place at the stoichiometric LAO/STO interfaces.}

Combined with the fractional-charge correction from recently developed localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC), a functional, the fractional-spin LOSC (FSLOSC), is proposed. FSLOSC, a correction to commonly used functional approximations, introduces the explicit derivative discontinuity and largely restores the flat-plane behavior of electronic energy at fractional charges and fractional spins. In addition to improving results from conventional functionals for the prediction of ionization potentials, electron affinities, quasiparticle spectra, and reaction barrier heights, FSLOSC properly describes the dissociation of ionic species, single bonds, and multiple bonds without breaking space or spin symmetry and corrects the spurious fractional-charge dissociation of heteroatom molecules of conventional functionals. Thus, FSLOSC demonstrates success in reducing delocalization error and including strong correlation, within low-cost density functional approximation.},

  abstract = {Symmetry is a fundamental concept that plays a critical role in many chemical and physical phenomena and processes, which highlights the importance of theoretical methods to correctly handle symmetry. The recently developed localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC1) shows great improvement on the description of band gaps, photoemission spectra, and dissociation limits of cationic species. However, issues remain with LOSC1 in dealing with the symmetry and degeneracy of electronic states, which are also relevant to other methods using localization. In this work, we utilize a new method that deals with the physical-space and the energy-space localization on an equal footing. The resulting localized orbitals, i.e., orbitalets, are able to maintain more symmetry and the desired state degeneracy, which is important in calculating the electronic structure of both molecules and periodic bulk systems. Furthermore, the curvature matrix is redefined to improve potential energy curves for systems with stretched bonds, while retaining the correct dissociation limits. This new approach, termed LOSC2, includes only two fitting parameters. It maintains accuracy similar to that of LOSC1 over many properties, while overcoming LOSC1's deficiencies in symmetry and degeneracy. Our tests have shown that LOSC2 orbitalets possess the full- or subgroup of molecular symmetry if allowed, which preserves the state degeneracy. Tests on differently sized planar annulenes, odd-numbered allenes, and triphenylene again verify that LOSC2 is able to maintain the state degeneracy, while LOSC1 cannot. All the tests demonstrate the advantage of LOSC2 in the calculation of molecular systems and its potential for application to periodic bulk systems.}

No insertion of water was found in S2, but flipping of D1 Glu189 upon transition to S3 leads to the opening of a water channel and provides a space for incorporation of an additional oxygen ligand, resulting in an open cubane Mn4CaO6 cluster with an oxyl/oxo bridge. Structural changes of PSII between the different S states reve cooperative action of substrate water access, proton release, and dioxygen formation in photosynthetic water oxidation.}

It is also exact or nearly exact for a set of ``appropriate norms,'' including rare-gas atoms and nonbonded interactions.

We have thus analyzed the exchange energy of the inhomogeneous electron gas to third order in the deviation from a constant density. We give the symmetry properties obeyed by the corresponding second-order response function Lx, and demonstrate how Lx gives rise to gradient corrections to the exchange energy. The expansion, which is taken up to sixth order in the density gradient, also includes the Laplacian of the density. In the case of a statically screened Coulomb interaction, we have calculated the coefficients of second- and fourth-order gradient terms both analytically and numerically. In analogy with the corresponding results from linear-response theory, the fourth-order coefficient is shown to diverge as the screening is made to vanish. For the bare Coulomb interaction we have not succeeded in obtaining analytical results, and, due to numerical problems at small-q vectors, our numerically obtained coefficients have an estimated uncertainty of 20\%.}

Our precise measurement of the Fermi surface confirms the importance of spin-orbit coupling in this material and reveals that its effective value is enhanced by a factor of about 2, due to electronic correlations. The self-energies for the {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$} sheets are found to display significant angular dependence. By taking into account the multi-orbital composition of quasiparticle states, we determine self-energies associated with each orbital component directly from the experimental data. This analysis demonstrates that the perceived angular dependence does not imply momentum-dependent many-body effects but arises from a substantial orbital mixing induced by spin-orbit coupling. A comparison to single-site dynamical mean-field theory further supports the notion of dominantly local orbital self-energies and provides strong evidence for an electronic origin of the observed nonlinear frequency dependence of the self-energies, leading to ``kinks'' in the quasiparticle dispersion of Sr2RuO4.}

Moreover we compared excitation energies from total energy differences with the concept of the Slater transition state (STS) and with the difference of approximate and exact Kohn-Sham energies. By tuning the external oscillator frequency, one can realize the strong, intermediate and weak correlation regime within one system. The results are compared with exact charge densities, Kohn-Sham potentials, ground-state energies and excitation energies. Unlike previous papers on this model, we used self-consistent (and not the exact) charge densities as input for the density functional theory, which makes it possible to check the accuracy of the approximated density itself. We found that the LSDA describes the charge density even in the Wigner crystal limit qualitatively correct, although only SIC provides quantitatively satisfactory results. For all oscillator frequencies, the spurious wiggles in the GGA exchange potential are located near the classical turning point suggesting that they are a consequence of the divergence of the underlying Kirshnitz expansion in this region. It is also observed that the well known large error in the LSDA and GGA exchange potential is not present in self-interaction free methods such as HF and SIC giving rise to the assumption that self-interaction is responsible for this defect. KS eigenvalue differences (as zeroth approximations for excitation energies) calculated from the exact and LSDA effective potential are very close. Therefore, their common large difference with the exact excitation energies cannot be fixed by nonlocal corrections to the LSDA.},

  abstract = {Density Functional Theory (DFT) computational studies of the Mn4/Ca Oxygen Evolving Complex (OEC) region of Photosystem II in the paramagnetic S2 and S3 states of the water oxdizing catalytic cycle are described. These build upon recent advances in computationally understanding the detailed S1 state OEC geometries, revealed by the recent high resolution Photosystem II crystal structures of Shen et al., at 1.90\AA{} and 1.95\AA{} (Petrie et al., 2015, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 54, 7120). The models feature a `Low Oxidation Paradigm' assumption for the mean Mn oxidation states in the functional enzyme, with the mean oxidation levels being 3.0, 3.25 and 3.5 in S1, S2 and S3, respectively. These calculations are used to infer magnetic exchange interactions within the coupled OEC cluster, particularly in the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)-visible S2 and S3 states. Detailed computational estimates of the intrinsic magnitudes and molecular orientations of the 55Mn hyperfine tensors in the S2 state are presented. These parameters, together with the resultant spin projected hyperfine values are compared with recent appropriate experimental EPR data (Continuous Wave (CW), Electron-Nuclear Double Resonance (ENDOR) and ELDOR (Electron-Electron Double Resonance)-Detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (EDNMR)) from the OEC. It is found that an effective Coupled Dimer magnetic organization of the four Mn in the OEC cluster in the S2 and S3 states is able to quantitatively rationalize the observed 55Mn hyperfine data. This is consistent with structures we propose to represent the likely state of the OEC in the catalytically active form of the enzyme.}

  abstract = {We introduce HP, an implementation of density-functional perturbation theory, designed to compute Hubbard parameters (on-site U and inter-site V) in the framework of DFT+U and DFT+U+V. The code does not require the use of computationally expensive supercells of the traditional linear-response approach; instead, unit cells are used with monochromatic perturbations that significantly reduce the computational cost of determining Hubbard parameters. HP is an open-source software distributed under the terms of the GPL as a component of Quantum ESPRESSO. As with other components, HP is optimized to run on a variety of different platforms, from laptops to massively parallel architectures, using native mathematical libraries (LAPACK and FFTW) and a hierarchy of custom parallelization layers built on top of MPI. The effectiveness of the code is showcased by computing Hubbard parameters self-consistently for the phospho-olivine LixMn1/2Fe1/2PO4 (x=0,1/2,1) and by highlighting the accuracy of predictions of the geometry and Li intercalation voltages. Program summary Program Title: HP CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/xsbtkpknf7.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License v 2.0 Programming language: Fortran 95 External routines: HP is a tightly integrated component of the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution and requires the standard libraries linked by it: BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW, MPI. Nature of problem: Calculation of Hubbard interaction parameters for DFT+U and DFT+U+V. Solution method: Hubbard parameters are expressed in terms of the inverse response matrices to localized perturbations of the atomic occupations. The response matrices are computed using density-functional perturbation theory to first order (linear-response theory) in the reciprocal space, that allows to reconstruct the response to a localized perturbation (obtained from calculations in an appropriately sized supercell) as the superposition of the responses to a series of monochromatic perturbations in a primitive unit cell, thus reducing significantly the computational cost. The response matrices are computed via a self-consistent solution of the static Sternheimer equation, whose implementation does not require the calculation of any virtual states. Pseudopotentials (norm-conserving, ultrasoft, projector augmented wave) are used in conjunction with plane-wave basis sets and periodic boundary conditions. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Local and semi-local exchange-correlation kernels only. Noncollinear spin-polarized formalism is not supported, only collinear spin-polarized or non-spin-polarized cases can be treated. Spin-orbit coupling cannot be used. Calculation of Hund's J is not supported. Multiple Hubbard channels per atom are not supported. The Hubbard manifold can be only constructed on atomic orbitals, both orthogonalized and non-orthogonalized, while Wannier functions (as well as other localized basis sets) are not supported. The linear-response approach we adopt here typically results in Hubbard parameters that are unphysically large for closed shell states [1]. No virtual orbitals are used, nor even calculated. The distribution file of this program can be downloaded from the Quantum ESPRESSO website: http://www.quantum-espresso.org/, and the development version of this program can be downloaded via Git from the GitLab website: https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e. Interactions with end users of the HP code happen via a mailing-list forum of Quantum ESPRESSO: https://www.quantum-espresso.org/forum. Documentation of the HP code is tightly coupled with the code and is done via standard code comments; different subroutines that implement different equations of the DFPT formalism contain references to the two main papers [2], [3] describing in detail theory behind the implementation.},

  abstract = {The design of novel cathode materials for Li-ion batteries would greatly benefit from accurate first-principles predictions of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties as well as intercalation voltages in compounds containing transition-metal elements. For such systems, density-functional theory (DFT) with standard (semi)local exchange-correlation functionals is of limited use as it often fails due to strong self-interaction errors that are especially relevant in the partially filled {$d$} shells. Here, we perform a detailed comparative study of the phospho-olivine cathode materials Li{$x$}⁢MnPO4, Li{$x$}⁢FePO4 and the mixed transition metal Li{$x$}⁢Mn1/2⁢Fe1/2⁢PO4 ({$x$}=0,1/4,1/2,3/4,1) using four electronic-structure methods: DFT, DFT+{$U$}, DFT+{$U$}+{$V$}, and HSE06. We show that DFT+{$U$}+{$V$}, with onsite {$U$} and intersite {$V$} Hubbard parameters determined from first principles and self-consistently with respect to the structural parameters by means of density-functional perturbation theory (linear response), provides the most accurate description of the electronic structure of these challenging compounds. In particular, we demonstrate that DFT+{$U$}+{$V$} displays very clearly ``digital'' changes in oxidation states of the transition-metal ions in all compounds, including the mixed-valence phases occurring at intermediate Li concentrations, leading to voltages in remarkable agreement with experiments. We show that the inclusion of intersite Hubbard interactions is essential for the accurate prediction of thermodynamic quantities, balancing the drive for localization induced by the onsite {$U$} with intersite {$V$} orbital hybridizations. At variance with other methods, DFT+{$U$}+{$V$} describes accurately such localization-hybridization interplay, and thus opens the door for the study of more complex cathode materials as well as for a reliable exploration of the chemical space of compounds for Li-ion batteries.}

  abstract = {Recently, exchange-correlation potentials in density functional theory were developed with the goal of providing improved band gaps in solids. Among them, the semilocal potentials are particularly interesting for large systems since they lead to calculations that are much faster than with hybrid functionals or methods like GW. We present an exhaustive comparison of semilocal exchange-correlation potentials for band gap calculations on a large test set of solids, and particular attention is paid to the potential HLE16 proposed by Verma and Truhlar. It is shown that the most accurate potential is the modified Becke--Johnson potential, which, most noticeably, is much more accurate than all other semilocal potentials for strongly correlated systems. This can be attributed to its additional dependence on the kinetic energy density. It is also shown that the modified Becke--Johnson potential is at least as accurate as the hybrid functionals and more reliable for solids with large band gaps.}

Yet, a general machine learning potential that spans the chemical space of catalysis is still out of reach. A significant hurdle is obtaining access to training data across a wide range of materials. One important class of materials where data is lacking are oxides, which inhibits models from studying the Oxygen Evolution Reaction and oxide electrocatalysis more generally. To address this we developed the Open Catalyst 2022(OC22) dataset, consisting of 62,521 Density Functional Theory (DFT) relaxations (\textasciitilde 9,884,504 single point calculations) across a range of oxide materials, coverages, and adsorbates (*H, *O, *N, *C, *OOH, *OH, *OH2, *O2, *CO). We define generalized tasks to predict the total system energy that are applicable across catalysis, develop baseline performance of several graph neural networks (SchNet, DimeNet++, ForceNet, SpinConv, PaiNN, GemNet-dT, GemNet-OC), and provide pre-defined dataset splits to establish clear benchmarks for future efforts. For all tasks, we study whether combining datasets leads to better results, even if they contain different materials or adsorbates. Specifically, we jointly train models on Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) Dataset and OC22, or fine-tune pretrained OC20 models on OC22. In the most general task, GemNet-OC sees a \textasciitilde 32\% improvement in energy predictions through fine-tuning and a \textasciitilde 9\% improvement in force predictions via joint training. Surprisingly, joint training on both the OC20 and much smaller OC22 datasets also improves total energy predictions on OC20 by \textasciitilde 19\%. The dataset and baseline models are open sourced, and a public leaderboard will follow to encourage continued community developments on the total energy tasks and data.},

  abstract = {The existence of band gaps in both the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and paramagnetic (PM) phases of the classic NaCl-structure Mott insulators MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO is traditionally viewed and taught as a manifestation of strong correlation whereby insulation results from electrons moving across the lattice forming states with doubly occupied d orbitals on certain atomic sites and empty d orbitals on other sites. Within such theories, the gap of the AFM and PM phases of these oxides emerges even in the absence of spatial symmetry breaking. The need for such a correlated picture is partially based on the known failure of the commonly used band models for the PM phase that assume for such a spin disordered state the macroscopically averaged NaCl structure, where all transition metal (TM) sites are symmetry-equivalent (a monomorphous description), producing a gapless PM state with zero magnetic moments, in sharp conflict with experiment. Here, we seek to understand the minimum theoretical description needed to capture the leading descriptors of ground state Mott insulation in the classic, 3d monoxide Mott systems---gapping and moment formation in the AFM and PM phase. As noted by previous authors, the spin-ordered AFM phase in these materials already shows in band theory a significant band gap when one doubles the NaCl unit cell by permitting different potentials for transition-metal atoms with different spins. For the spin-disordered PM phase, we allow analogously larger NaCl-type supercells where each TM site can have different spin direction and local bonding environments (i.e., disordered), yet the total spin is zero. Such a polymorphous description has the flexibility to acquire symmetry-breaking energy-lowering patterns that can lift the degeneracy of the d orbitals and develop large on-site magnetic moments without violating the global, averaged NaCl symmetry. Electrons are exchanged between spin-up and spin-down bands to create closed-shell insulating configurations that lend themselves to a single determinental description. It turns out that such a polymorphous description of the structure within the single-determinant, mean-field, Bloch periodic band structure approach (based on DFT+U) allows large on-site magnetic moments to develop spontaneously, leading to significant (1--3 eV) band gaps and large local moments in the AFM and PM phases of the classic NaCl-structure Mott insulators MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO in agreement with experiment. We adapt to the spin disordered polymorphous configurations the ``special quasirandom structure'' (SQS) construct known from the theory of disordered substitutional alloys whereby supercell approximants which represent the best random configuration average (not individual snapshots) for finite (64, 216 atoms, or larger) supercells of a given lattice symmetry are constructed. We conclude that the basic features of these paradigmatic Mott insulators can be approximated by the physics included in energy-lowering symmetry broken DFT.}

Starting from total energies obtained with the help of the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem, these physical observables are calculated according to their basic definition by differences of the total energies of the N-, (N-1)-, and (N+1)-electron system. The response functions entering the ACFD theorem are approximated here by the direct random phase approximation (dRPA). For a set of prototypical semiconductors and insulators it is shown that even with this quite drastic approximation the resulting band gaps are very close to experiment and of a similar quality to those from the computationally more involved GW approximation. By going beyond the dRPA in the future the accuracy of the calculated band gaps may be significantly improved further.}

Important details of its mechanism are not well understood. In order to understand the mechanism of water splitting, we perform here large-scale density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the active site of PSII in different oxidation, spin and ligand states. Prior to formation of the O-O bond, we find that all manganese atoms are oxidized to Mn(IV) in the S3 state, consistent with earlier studies. We find here, however, that the formation of the S3 state is coupled to the movement of a calcium-bound hydroxide (W3) from the Ca to a Mn (Mn1 or Mn4) in a process that is triggered by the formation of a tyrosyl radical (Tyr-161) and its protonated base, His-190. We find that subsequent oxidation and deprotonation of this hydroxide on Mn1 result in formation of an oxyl-radical that can exergonically couple with one of the oxo-bridges (O5), forming an O-O bond. When O2 leaves the active site, a second Ca-bound water molecule reorients to bridge the gap between the manganese ions Mn1 and Mn4, forming a new oxo-bridge for the next reaction cycle. Our findings are consistent with experimental data, and suggest that the calcium ion may control substrate water access to the water oxidation sites.}

  abstract = {We introduce a method that allows for the calculation of quasiparticle spectra in the GW approximation, yet avoiding any explicit reference to empty one-electron states. This is achieved by expressing the irreducible polarizability operator and the self-energy operator through a set of linear response equations, which are solved using a Lanczos-chain algorithm. We first validate our approach by calculating the vertical ionization energies of the benzene molecule and then show its potential by addressing the spectrum of a large molecule such as free-base tetraphenylporphyrin.}

These density-functional results are compared to the corresponding quantities obtained from a variety of commonly used approximate density functionals, namely, the local-density approximation and various generalized gradient approximations, in order to test the accuracy of the approximate functionals. Although the generalized gradient approximations yield improved energies compared to the local-density approximation, the exchange and correlation potentials (especially the latter) obtained from the generalized gradient approximations are in poor agreement with the corresponding exact potentials. The large-distance asymptotic behavior of the exact exchange-correlation potential to O(1/r4) is found to agree with theoretical predictions. The short-range behavior of the exchange-correlation potential is very close to quadratic. The prospects for improved generalized gradient approximations are discussed.}

S2-minus-S1 FTIR difference spectra showed that the protein conformations of the OEC, revealed by the changes in amide I and II bands, were significantly altered upon depletion of all the extrinsic proteins, but mostly recovered when PsbV was rebound with the support of other extrinsic proteins. The recovery of protein conformations correlated well with O2 evolution activity.

  abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII) is a membrane protein complex that performs light-induced electron transfer and oxygen evolution from water. PSII consists of 19 or 20 subunits in its crystal form and binds various cofactors such as chlorophyll a, plastoquinone, carotenoid, and lipids. After initial light excitation, the charge separation produces an electron, which is transferred to a plastoquinone molecule (QA) and then to another plastoquinone (QB). PsbM is a low-molecular-weight subunit with one transmembrane helix, and is located in the monomer-monomer interface of the PSII dimer. The function of PsbM has been reported to be stabilization of the PSII dimer and maintenance of electron transfer efficiency of PSII based on previous X-ray crystal structure analysis at a resolution of 4.2 \AA. In order to elucidate the structure-function relationships of PsbM in detail, we improved the quality of PSII crystals from a PsbM-deleted mutant ({$\Delta$}PsbM-PSII) of Thermosynechococcus elongatus, and succeeded in improving the diffraction quality to a resolution of 2.2 \AA. X-ray crystal structure analysis of {$\Delta$}PsbM-PSII showed that electron densities for the PsbM subunit and neighboring carotenoid and detergent molecules were absent in the monomer-monomer interface. The overall structure of {$\Delta$}PsbM-PSII was similar with wild-type PSII, but the arrangement of the hydrophobic transmembrane subunits was significantly changed by the deletion of PsbM, resulting in a slight widening of the lipid hole involving QB. The lipid hole-widening further induced structural changes of the bicarbonate ion coordinated to the non-heme Fe(II) atom and destabilized the polypeptide chains around the QB binding site located far from the position of PsbM. The fluorescence decay measurement indicated that the electron transfer rate from QA to QB was decreased in {$\Delta$}PsbM-PSII compared to wild-type PSII. The functional change in electron transfer efficiency was fully interpreted based on structural changes caused by the deletion of the PsbM subunit.}

  abstract = {First-principles calculations in crystalline structures are often performed with a planewave basis set. To make the number of basis functions tractable two approximations are usually introduced: core electrons are frozen and the diverging Coulomb potential near the nucleus is replaced by a smoother expression. The norm-conserving pseudopotential was the first successful method to apply these approximations in a fully ab initio way. Later on, more efficient and more exact approaches were developed based on the ultrasoft and the projector augmented wave formalisms. These formalisms are however more complex and developing new features in these frameworks is usually more difficult than in the norm-conserving framework. Most of the existing tables of norm-conserving pseudopotentials, generated long ago, do not include the latest developments, are not systematically tested or are not designed primarily for high precision. In this paper, we present our PseudoDojo framework for developing and testing full tables of pseudopotentials, and demonstrate it with a new table generated with the ONCVPSP approach. The PseudoDojo is an open source project, building on the AbiPy package, for developing and systematically testing pseudopotentials. At present it contains 7 different batteries of tests executed with ABINIT, which are performed as a function of the energy cutoff. The results of these tests are then used to provide hints for the energy cutoff for actual production calculations. Our final set contains 141 pseudopotentials split into a standard and a stringent accuracy table. In total around 70,000 calculations were performed to test the pseudopotentials. The process of developing the final table led to new insights into the effects of both the core-valence partitioning and the non-linear core corrections on the stability, convergence, and transferability of norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The PseudoDojo hence provides a set of pseudopotentials and general purpose tools for further testing and development, focusing on highly accurate calculations and their use in the development of ab initio packages. The pseudopotential files are available on the PseudoDojo web-interface pseudo-dojo.org under the name NC (ONCVPSP) v0.4 in the psp8, UPF2, and PSML 1.1 formats. The webinterface also provides the inputs, which are compatible with the 3.3.1 and higher versions of ONCVPSP. All tests have been performed with ABINIT 8.4.},

Their insulating character and structural distortions are often ascribed to dynamical electronic correlations within a universal, symmetry-conserving paradigm. This view restricts predictive theory to complex computational schemes, going beyond density functional theory (DFT). Here, we show that, if one allows symmetry-breaking energy-lowering crystal symmetry reductions and electronic instabilities within DFT, one successfully and systematically recovers the trends in the observed band gaps, magnetic moments, type of magnetic and crystallographic ground state, bond disproportionation and ligand hole effects, Mott vs. charge transfer insulator behaviors, and the amplitude of structural deformation modes including Jahn-Teller in low temperature spin-ordered and high temperature disordered paramagnetic phases. We then provide a classification of the four mechanisms of gap formation and establish DFT as a reliable base platform to study the ground state properties in complex oxides.}

  abstract = {Maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) are routinely used to compute from first-principles advanced materials properties that require very dense Brillouin zone integration and to build accurate tight-binding models for scale-bridging simulations. At the same time, high-throughput (HT) computational materials design is an emergent field that promises to accelerate reliable and cost-effective design and optimisation of new materials with target properties. The use of MLWFs in HT workflows has been hampered by the fact that generating MLWFs automatically and robustly without any user intervention and for arbitrary materials is, in general, very challenging. We address this problem directly by proposing a procedure for automatically generating MLWFs for HT frameworks. Our approach is based on the selected columns of the density matrix method and we present the details of its implementation in an AiiDA workflow. We apply our approach to a dataset of 200 bulk crystalline materials that span a wide structural and chemical space. We assess the quality of our MLWFs in terms of the accuracy of the band-structure interpolation that they provide as compared to the band-structure obtained via full first-principles calculations. Finally, we provide a downloadable virtual machine that can be used to reproduce the results of this paper, including all first-principles and atomistic simulations as well as the computational workflows.},

Deviation from this condition is indicative of poor predictive capabilities for electronic structure, in particular of ionization energies, fundamental gaps, and charge transfer. In this article, we take a new look at the deviation from linearity (i.e., curvature) in the solid-state limit by considering two different ways of approaching it: a large finite system of increasing size and a crystal represented by an increasingly large reference cell with periodic boundary conditions. We show that the curvature approaches vanishing values in both limits, even for functionals which yield poor predictions of electronic structure, and therefore cannot be used as a diagnostic or constructive tool in solids. We find that the approach towards zero curvature is different in each of the two limits, owing to the presence of a compensating backgroun...},

  abstract = {Charge carrier localization in extended atomic systems has been described previously as being driven by disorder, point defects, or distortions of the ionic lattice. Here we show for the first time by means of first-principles computations that charge carriers can spontaneously localize due to a purely electronic effect in otherwise perfectly ordered structures. Optimally tuned range-separated density functional theory and many-body perturbation calculations within the GW approximation reveal that in trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene the hole density localizes on a length scale of several nanometers. This is due to exchange-induced translational symmetry breaking of the charge density. Ionization potentials, optical absorption peaks, excitonic binding energies, and the optimally tuned range parameter itself all become independent of polymer length as it exceeds the critical localization length. Moreover, we find that lattice disorder and the formation of a polaron result from the charge localization in contrast to the traditional view that lattice distortions precede charge localization. Our results can explain experimental findings that polarons in conjugated polymers form instantaneously after exposure to ultrafast light pulses.}

  abstract = {Quasiparticle (QP) excitations are extremely important for understanding and predicting charge transfer and transport in molecules, nanostructures, and extended systems. Since density functional theory (DFT) within the Kohn--Sham (KS) formulation does not provide reliable QP energies, many-body perturbation techniques such as the GW approximation are essential. The main practical drawback of GW implementations is the high computational scaling with system size, prohibiting its use in extended, open boundary systems with many dozens of electrons or more. Recently, a stochastic formulation of GW (sGW) was presented (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2014, 113, 076402) with a near-linear-scaling complexity, illustrated for a series of silicon nanocrystals reaching systems of more than 3000 electrons. This advance provides a route for many-body calculations on very large systems that were impossible with previous approaches. While earlier we have shown the gentle scaling of sGW, its accuracy was not extensively demonstrated. Therefore, we show that this new sGW approach is very accurate by calculating the ionization energies of a group of sufficiently small molecules where a comparison to other GW codes is still possible. Using a set of 10 such molecules, we demonstrate that sGW provides reliable vertical ionization energies in close agreement with benchmark deterministic GW results (J. Chem. Theory Comput, 2015, 11, 5665), with mean (absolute) deviation of 0.05 and 0.09 eV. For completeness, we also provide a detailed review of the sGW theory and numerical implementation.}

On the basis of these results, we highlight regions of the PSII protein in which changes have indirect effects on the S1, S2, and S3 oxidation states of the OEC while still allowing photosynthetic activity.}

The standard self-interaction correction (SIC) of Perdew and Zunger mends some of these failures but spoils such essential properties as thermochemistry and equilibrium bond lengths. The Perdew-Zunger SIC seems to overcorrect many-electron systems. In this paper, we propose a modified SIC, which is scaled down in many-electron regions. The new SIC has an improved performance for many molecular properties, including total energies, atomization energies, barrier heights of chemical reactions, ionization potentials, electron affinities, and bond lengths. The local spin-density approximation (LSDA) benefits from SIC more than higher-level functionals do. The scaled-down SIC has only one adjustable parameter. Rationalization of the optimal value of this parameter enables us to construct an almost-nonempirical version of the scaled-down SIC-LSDA, which is significantly better than uncorrected LSDA and even better than the uncorrected generalized gradient approximation. We present an analysis of the formal properties of the scaled-down SIC and define possible directions for further improvements. In particular, we find that exactness for all one-electron densities does not guarantee correct asymptotics for the exchange-correlation potential of a many-electron system.}

  abstract = {In the exact theory, the ground state energy of an open system varies linearly when the electron number is changed between two adjacent integers. This linear dependence is not reproduced by common approximate density functionals. Deviation from linearity in this dependence has been suggested as a basis for the concept of many-electron self-interaction error (SIE). In this paper, we quantify many-electron SIE of a number of approximations by performing calculations on fractionally charged atoms. We demonstrate the direct relevance of these studies to such problems of common approximate functionals as instabilities of anions, spurious fractional charges on dissociated atoms, and poor description of charge transfer. Semilocal approximations have the largest many-electron SIE, which is only slightly reduced in typical global hybrids. In these approximations the energy versus fractional electron number curves upward, while in Hartree-Fock theory the energy curves downward. Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction [Phys. Rev. B 23, 5048 (1981)] significantly reduces the many-electron SIE of semilocal functionals but impairs their accuracy for equilibrium properties. In contrast, a long-range corrected hybrid functional can be nearly many-electron SIE-free in many cases (for reasons we discuss) and at the same time performs remarkably well for many molecular properties.}

Recent breakthroughs in femtosecond X-ray crystallography offer the possibility of collecting diffraction data from the X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) before radiation damage of the sample, thereby overcoming the main challenge of conventional X-ray diffraction methods. However, the interpretation of XFEL data from PSII intermediates is challenging because of the issues regarding data-processing, uncertainty on the precise positions of light oxygen atoms next to heavy metal centers, and different kinetics of the S-state transition in microcrystals compared to solution. Here, we summarize recent advances and outstanding challenges in PSII structure-function determination with emphasis on the implementation of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics techniques combined with isomorphous difference Fourier maps, direct methods, and high-resolution spectroscopy. P hotosystem II (PSII) is the only known protein complex capable of catalyzing direct solar water-splitting into O 2 , protons, and electrons. 1-4 Understanding its structure- function relations can provide fundamental insights, essential for the design of artificial photosynthetic systems.

The examples described here illustrate the utility of SACs in a broad scope of industrially important reactions and highlight the advantages these catalysts have over those presently used. SACs have well-defined active centres, such that unique opportunities exist for the rational design of new catalysts with high activities, selectivities and stabilities. Indeed, given a certain practical application, we can often design a suitable SAC; thus, the field has developed very rapidly and afforded promising catalyst leads. Moreover, the control we have over certain SAC structures paves the way for designing base metal catalysts with the activities of noble metal catalysts.

The orbital transformation maps the orthogonality constrained energy functional to an approximate unconstrained functional, which is correct to some order in a neighborhood of an orthogonal but approximate solution. A conjugate gradient scheme can then be used to find the ground state orbitals from the minimization of a sequence of transformed unconstrained electronic energy functionals. The technique provides an efficient, robust, and numerically stable approach to direct total energy minimization in first principles electronic structure theory based on tight-binding, Hartree--Fock, or density functional theory. For sparse problems, where both the orbitals and the effective s...},

Electronic correlation effects are taken into account using one of the most advanced methods currently available, namely a linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) approach wherein the treatment of localized iron 3d electrons is further refined using dynamical mean-field theory. This combination of methods explicitly accounts for dynamical and multireference quantum physics, such as valence and spin fluctuations, of the 3d electrons, while treating a significant proportion of the protein (more than 1,000 atoms) with DFT. The computed electronic structure of the myoglobin complexes and the nature of the Fe--O2 bonding are validated against experimental spectroscopic observables. We elucidate and solve a long-standing problem related to the quantum-mechanical description of the respiration process, namely that DFT calculations predict a strong imbalance between O2 and CO binding, favoring the latter to an unphysically large extent. We show that the explicit inclusion of the many-body effects induced by the Hund\{\textbackslash rq\}s coupling mechanism results in the correct prediction of similar binding energies for oxy- and carbonmonoxymyoglobin.}

Wannier--Koopmans method (WKM) was recently developed for band gap calculations with accuracy on a par with more complicated methods. WKM has been tested for main group covalent semiconductors, alkali halides, 2D materials, and organic crystals. Here we apply the WKM to another interesting type of material system: the transition metal (TM) oxides. TM oxides can be classified as either with d0 or d10 closed shell occupancy or partially occupied open shell configuration, and the latter is known to be strongly correlated Mott insulators. We found that, while WKM provides adequate band gaps for the d0 and d10 TM oxides, it fails to provide correct band gaps for the group with partially occupied d states. This issue is also found in other mean-field approaches like the GW calculations. We believe that the problem comes from a strong interaction between the occupied and unoccupied d-state Wannier functions in a partially occupied d-state system. We also found that, for pseudopotential calculations including deep core levels, it is necessary to remove the electron densities of these deep core levels in the Hartree and exchange--correlation energy functional when calculating the WKM correction parameters for the d-state Wannier functions.},

  abstract = {High-throughput (HTP) material design is an emerging field and has been proved to be powerful in the prediction of novel functional materials. In this work, an HTP effort has been carried out for thermoelectric chalcogenides with diamond-like structures on the newly established Materials Informatics Platform (MIP). Specifically, the relaxation time is evaluated by a reliable yet efficient method, which greatly improves the accuracy of HTP electrical transport calculations. The results show that all the compounds may have power factors over 10 {$\mu$}W/cm{$\cdot$}K2 if fully optimized. A new series of diamond-like chalcogenides with an atomic ratio of 1:2:4 possess relatively higher electrical transport properties among all the compounds investigated. One particular compound, CdIn2Te4, and its variations have been verified experimentally with a peak ZT over 1.0. Further analysis reveals the existence of general conductive networks and the similar Pisarenko relations under the same anion sublattice, and the transport distribution function is found to be a good indicator for the power factors for the compounds investigated. This work demonstrates a successful case study in HTP material screening.}

In a recent work by the present authors, explicit expressions for bandgap prediction with all common types of exchange-correlation functionals have been derived without invoking the concept of exchange-correlation energy functional derivative discontinuity at all. We here analyze the two approaches and establish their connection and difference. The present analysis further leads to several important results: (1) The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in DFT has as much meaning in describing electron addition as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in describing electron removal. (2) Every term in the total energy functional contributes to the energy gap because of the discontinuity of the derivative of the density (or density matrix) with respect to the number of electrons, (({$\rho$} s(r{$\prime$},r))/N)v s, at integers. (3) Consistent with the Perdew-Levy-Sham-Schl\"uter conclusion that the exact Kohn-Sham energy gap differs from the fundamental bandgap by a finite correction due to the functional derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation energy, we show that the exchange-correlation functional cannot be an explicit and differentiable functional of the electron density, either local or nonlocal. The last result is further strengthened when we consider Mott insulators. There, the exact exchange-correlation functional needs to have an explicitly discontinuous (nondifferentiable) dependence on the density or the density matrix. (4) We obtain exact conditions on the derivatives of total energy with respect to the spin-up and spin-down number of electrons. \copyright{} 2012 American Institute of Physics.}

The second type of flat-planes condition occurs when the energy has a derivative discontinuity on a line segment where the spin polarization, N{$\alpha$} - N{$\beta$}, is an integer, but does not have a discontinuity associated with an integer number of electrons. Type 2 flat planes are rare - we observed just 15 type 2 flat-planes conditions out of the 4884 cases we tested - but their mere existence has implications for the design of exchange-correlation energy density functionals. To facilitate the development of functionals that have the correct behavior with respect to both fractional number of electrons and fractional spin polarization, we present a dataset for the chromium atom and its ions that can be used to test new functionals.},

Accurate prediction of these energies has been rather challenging for ground-state density functional methods, because the commonly adopted density function approximations suffer from delocalization error. In this work, by presuming a quantitative correspondence between the quasiparticle energies and the generalized Kohn--Sham orbital energies, and employing a previously developed global scaling correction approach, we achieve substantially improved prediction of molecular quasiparticle and excitation energies. In addition, we also extend our previous study on temporary anions in resonant states, which are associated with negative molecular electron affinities. The proposed approach does not require any explicit self-consistent field calculation on the excited-state species, and is thus highly efficient and convenient for practical purposes.}

Next, we consider a perturbative one-shot approach in which the single-particle eigenvalues are calculated with the wave functions obtained at the semilocal level. In this way, the computational cost is reduced by {$\sim$}85\% without loss of accuracy. The scheme is found to be robust upon consideration of different defect species and functional forms.}

Here, the electronic structure of InAs(001), InAs(111), and InSb(110) surfaces is studied using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Large-scale first principles simulations are enabled by using DFT calculations with a machine-learned Hubbard U correction [npj Comput. Mater. 6, 180 (2020)]. To facilitate direct comparison with ARPES results, a ``bulk unfolding'' scheme is implemented by projecting the calculated band structure of a supercell surface slab model onto the bulk primitive cell. For all three surfaces, a good agreement is found between DFT calculations and ARPES. For InAs(001), the simulations clarify the effect of the surface reconstruction. Different reconstructions are found to produce distinctive surface states, which may be detected by ARPES with low photon energies. For InAs(111) and InSb(110), the simulations help elucidate the effect of oxidation. Owing to larger charge transfer from As to O than from Sb to O, oxidation of InAs(111) leads to significant band bending and produces an electron pocket, whereas oxidation of InSb(110) does not. The combined theoretical and experimental results may inform the design of quantum devices based on InAs and InSb semiconductors, for example, topological qubits utilizing the Majorana zero modes.},

  abstract = {Halide perovskites (HPs) are widely viewed as promising photovoltaic and light-emitting materials for their suitable band gaps in the visible spectrum. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing (semi)local exchange-correlation functionals usually underestimate the band gaps for these systems. Accurate descriptions of the electronic structures of HPs often demand higher-order levels of theory such as the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid density functional and {$G$}⁢{$W$} approximations that are much more computationally expensive than standard DFT. Here, we investigate three representative types of HPs, {$A$}⁢{$B$}⁢{$X$}3 halide perovskites, vacancy-ordered double perovskites, and bond disproportionated halide perovskites (BDHPs), using DFT+{$U$}+{$V$} with onsite {$U$} and intersite {$V$} Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently without a priori assumption. The inclusion of Hubbard corrections improves the band gap prediction accuracy for all three types of HPs to a similar level of advanced methods. Moreover, the self-consistent Hubbard {$U$} is a meaningful indicator of the true local charge state of multivalence metal atoms in HPs. The inclusion of the intersite Hubbard {$V$} is crucial to properly capture the hybridization between valence electrons on neighboring atoms in BDHPs that have breathing-mode distortions of halide octahedra. In particular, the simultaneous convergence of both Hubbard parameters and crystal geometry enables a band gap prediction accuracy superior to HSE for BDHPs but at a fraction of the cost. Our work highlights the importance of using self-consistent Hubbard parameters when dealing with HPs that often possess intricate competitions between onsite localization and intersite hybridization.}

We derive the excited-state (generalized) Kohn-Sham equations. The minimum of all three functionals is the ground-state energy and, for ground states, they are all equivalent to the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham method. The other stationary points of the functionals provide the excited-state energies and electron densities, establishing the foundation for the \$\textbackslash Delta SCF\$ method.},

PS II, a membrane-bound multi-subunit pigment protein complex, couples the one-electron photochemistry at the reaction centre with the four-electron redox chemistry of water oxidation at the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). Under illumination, the OEC cycles through five intermediate S-states (S 0 to S 4) 1 , in which S 1 is the dark-stable state and S 3 is the last semi-stable state before O--O bond formation and O 2 evolution 2,3 . A detailed understanding of the O--O bond formation mechanism remains a challenge, and will require elucidation of both the structures of the OEC in the different S-states and the binding of the two substrate waters to the catalytic site 4--6 . Here we report the use of femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) to obtain damage-free, room temperature structures of dark-adapted (S 1), two-flash illuminated (2F; S 3 -enriched), and ammonia-bound two-flash illuminated (2F-NH 3 ; S 3 -enriched) PS II.

Two ab initio methods have been developed to compute the U parameter based on either constrained DFT (CDFT) or unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) theory. Previous studies have demonstrated the success of both methods in typical open-shell materials such as FeO and NiO. In this Communication we report numerical instability issues that arise for the CDFT method when applied to closed-shell transition metals, by using ZnO and Cu2O as examples. By contrast, the UHF method behaves much more robustly for both closed- and open-shell materials, making it more suitable for treating closed-shell transition metals, as well as main group elements.},

  abstract = {A new method for predicting core level binding energies (CLBEs) is developed by both localizing the core-level states and describing the screening effect. CLBEs contain important information about the electronic structure, elemental chemistry, and chemical environment of molecules and materials. Theoretical study of CLBEs can provide insights for analyzing and interpreting the experimental results obtained from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in which the overlapping of signals is very common. The localization of core-level holes is important for the theoretical calculation of CLBEs. Predicting CLBEs from commonly used density functional approximations (DFAs) is challenging, because conventional DFAs often produce delocalized core-level states, especially when degenerate core-level states exist. In this work, we combine the localization procedure from the localized orbital scaling correction method and the curvature matrix generalized from the exact second-order correction method that contains the screening effect, and the resulting approach can accurately predict CLBEs from ground-state density functional calculations.},

  abstract = {Recently, Zacharias et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 177401 (2015)] developed an ab initio theory of temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra and band gaps in semiconductors and insulators. In that work, the zero-point renormalization and the temperature dependence were obtained by sampling the nuclear wave functions using a stochastic approach. In the present work, we show that the stochastic sampling of Zacharias et al. can be replaced by fully deterministic supercell calculations based on a single optimal configuration of the atomic positions. We demonstrate that a single calculation is able to capture the temperature-dependent band-gap renormalization including quantum nuclear effects in direct-gap and indirect-gap semiconductors, as well as phonon-assisted optical absorption in indirect-gap semiconductors. In order to demonstrate this methodology, we calculate from first principles the temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra and the renormalization of direct and indirect band gaps in silicon, diamond, and gallium arsenide, and we obtain good agreement with experiment and with previous calculations. In this work we also establish the formal connection between the Williams-Lax theory of optical transitions and the related theories of indirect absorption by Hall, Bardeen, and Blatt, and of temperature-dependent band structures by Allen and Heine. The present methodology enables systematic ab initio calculations of optical absorption spectra at finite temperature, including both direct and indirect transitions. This feature will be useful for high-throughput calculations of optical properties at finite temperature and for calculating temperature-dependent optical properties using high-level theories such as GW and Bethe-Salpeter approaches.}

  abstract = {Calculations of electronic and optical properties of solids at finite temperature including electron-phonon interactions and quantum zero-point renormalization have enjoyed considerable progress during the past few years. Among the emerging methodologies in this area, we recently proposed an approach to compute optical spectra at finite temperature including phonon-assisted quantum processes via a single supercell calculation [Zacharias and Giustino, Phys. Rev. B 94, 075125 (2016)]. In the present work we considerably expand the scope of our previous theory starting from a compact reciprocal space formulation, and we demonstrate that this improved approach provides accurate temperature-dependent band structures in three-dimensional and two-dimensional materials, using a special set of atomic displacements in a single supercell calculation. We also demonstrate that our special displacement reproduces the thermal ellipsoids obtained from x-ray crystallography and yields accurate thermal averages of the mean-square atomic displacements. This enhanced version of the special displacement method enables nonperturbative, robust, and straightforward ab initio calculations of the electronic and optical properties of solids at finite temperature, and can easily be used as a postprocessing step to any electronic structure code. To illustrate the capabilities of this method, we investigate the temperature-dependent band structures and atomic displacement parameters of prototypical nonpolar and polar semiconductors and of a prototypical two-dimensional semiconductor, namely Si, GaAs, and monolayer MoS2, and we obtain excellent agreement with previous calculations and experiments. Given its simplicity and numerical stability, the present development is suited for high-throughput calculations of band structures, quasiparticle corrections, optical spectra, and transport coefficients at finite temperature.}

  abstract = {In oxygenic photosynthesis, water is oxidized and dioxygen is produced at a Mn 4 Ca complex bound to the proteins of photosystem II (PSII). Valence and coordination changes in its catalytic S-state cycle are of great interest. In room-temperature (in situ) experiments, time-resolved energy-sampling X-ray emission spectroscopy of the Mn K{$\beta$} 1,3 line after laser-flash excitation of PSII membrane particles was applied to characterize the redox transitions in the S-state cycle. The K{$\beta$} 1,3 line energies suggest a high-valence configuration of the Mn 4 Ca complex with Mn(III) 3 Mn(IV) in S 0 , Mn(III) 2 Mn(IV) 2 in S 1 , Mn(III)Mn(IV) 3 in S 2 , and Mn(IV) 4 in S 3 and, thus, manganese oxidation in each of the three accessible oxidizing transitions of the water-oxidizing complex. There are no indications of formation of a ligand radical, thus rendering partial water oxidation before reaching the S 4 state unlikely. The difference spectra of both manganese K{$\beta$} 1,3 emission and K-edge X-ray absorption display different shapes for Mn(III) oxidation in the S 2 {$\rightarrow$} S 3 transition when compared to Mn(III) oxidation in the S 1 {$\rightarrow$} S 2 transition. Comparison to spectra of manganese compounds with known structures and oxidation states and varying metal coordination environments suggests a change in the manganese ligand environment in the S 2 {$\rightarrow$} S 3 transition, which could be oxidation of five-coordinated Mn(III) to six-coordinated Mn(IV). Conceivable options for the rearrangement of (substrate) water species and metal-ligand bonding patterns at the Mn 4 Ca complex in the S 2 {$\rightarrow$} S 3 transition are discussed. T he manganese-calcium complex (Mn 4 Ca) of photo-system II (PSII) is the catalyst of photochemical water oxidation in oxygenic photosynthesis. Driven by the energy of four visible light photons, it facilitates decomposition of two water molecules into four protons and four electrons during the generation of dioxygen (O 2). 1-5 The molecular structure and reaction cycle of the Mn 4 Ca complex inspire synthetic chemists in the development of water oxidation catalysts for solar fuel applications. 6-12 The crystal structure of the Mn 4 Ca complex has been determined at better than 2 \AA{} resolution, 13,14 and impressing progress in the understanding of its reactivity has been achieved. 1-5,9,15-18 The complex includes a Mn 3 CaO 4 cubane cluster, which is (hydr)oxo-bridged to the fourth manganese ion and coordinated by carboxylate groups of glutamic and aspartic amino acids and by a histidine to the protein scaffold (Figure 1). Electron and proton abstraction events, storage and distribution of oxidation equivalents within the Mn 4 Ca complex, and structural changes at the metal center during the catalytic cycle have been much debated, and full consensus still has not been reached. 2-7,9,15-22}

To address this challenge, we develop a machine learning approach to efficiently predict density-density response functions (DDRF) in materials. For this, an atomic decomposition of the DDRF is introduced as well as the neighbourhood density-matrix descriptor both of which transform in the same way under rotations. The resulting DDRFs are then used to evaluate quasiparticle energies via the GW approach. This technique is called the ML-GW approach. To assess the accuracy of this method, we apply it to hydrogenated silicon clusters and find that it reliably reproduces HOMO-LUMO gaps and quasiparticle energy levels. The accuracy of the predictions deteriorates when the approach is applied to larger clusters than those included in the training set. These advances pave the way towards GW calculations of complex systems, such as disordered materials, liquids, interfaces and nanoparticles.},

A new photodamage model, the two-step photodamage model, suggests that photodamage to PSII initially occurs at the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) by light energy absorbed by manganese and that the PSII reaction center is subsequently damaged by light energy absorbed by photosynthetic pigments due to the limitation of electrons to the PSII reaction center. However, it is still uncertain whether this model is applicable to photodamage to PSII under visible light as manganese absorbs visible light only weakly. In the present study, we identified the initial site of photodamage to PSII upon illumination of visible light using PSII membrane fragments isolated from spinach leaves. When PSII samples were exposed to visible light in the presence of an exogenous electron acceptor, both PSII total activity and the PSII reaction centre activity declined due to photodamage. The supplemental addition of an electron donor to the PSII reaction centre alleviated the decline of the reaction centre activity but not the PSII total activity upon the light exposure. Our results demonstrate that visible light damages OEC prior to photodamage to the PSII reaction center, consistent with two-step photodamage model.}

  abstract = {Piecewise linearity of the energy with respect to fractional electron removal or addition is a requirement of an electronic structure method that necessitates the presence of a derivative discontinuity at integer electron occupation. Semi-local exchange-correlation (xc) approximations within density functional theory (DFT) fail to reproduce this behavior, giving rise to deviations from linearity with a convex global curvature that is evidence of many-electron, self-interaction error and electron delocalization. Popular functional tuning strategies focus on reproducing piecewise linearity, especially to improve predictions of optical properties. In a divergent approach, Hubbard U-augmented DFT (i.e., DFT+U) treats self-interaction errors by reducing the local curvature of the energy with respect to electron removal or addition from one localized subshell to the surrounding system. Although it has been suggested that DFT+U should simultaneously alleviate global and local curvature in the atomic limit, no detailed study on real systems has been carried out to probe the validity of this statement. In this work, we show when DFT+U should minimize deviations from linearity and demonstrate that a ``+U'' correction will never worsen the deviation from linearity of the underlying xc approximation. However, we explain varying degrees of efficiency of the approach over 27 octahedral transition metal complexes with respect to transition metal (Sc--Cu) and ligand strength (CO, NH3, and H2O) and investigate select pathological cases where the delocalization error is invisible to DFT+U within an atomic projection framework. Finally, we demonstrate that the global and local curvatures represent different quantities that show opposing behavior with increasing ligand field strength, and we identify where these two may still coincide.}

  abstract = {The active sites of heterogeneous catalysts can be difficult to identify and understand, and, hence, the introduction of active sites into catalysts to tailor their function is challenging. During the past two decades, scaling relationships have been established for important heterogeneous catalytic reactions. More specifically, a physical or chemical property of the reaction system, termed as a reactivity descriptor, scales with another property often in a linear manner, which can describe and/or predict the catalytic performance. In this Review, we describe scaling relationships and reactivity descriptors for heterogeneous catalysis, including electronic descriptors represented by d-band theory, structural descriptors, which can be directly applied to catalyst design, and, ultimately, universal descriptors. The prediction of trends in catalytic performance using reactivity descriptors can enable the rational design of catalysts and the efficient screening of high-throughput catalysts. Finally, we outline methods to break scaling relationships and, hence, to break the constraint that active sites pose on the catalytic performance.}

  abstract = {A novel nonempirical scaling correction method is developed to tackle the challenge of band gap prediction in density functional theory. For finite systems the scaling correction largely restores the straight-line behavior of electronic energy at fractional electron numbers. The scaling correction can be generally applied to a variety of mainstream density functional approximations, leading to significant improvement in the band gap prediction. In particular, the scaled version of a modified local density approximation predicts band gaps with an accuracy consistent for systems of all sizes, ranging from atoms and molecules to solids. The scaled modified local density approximation thus provides a useful tool to quantitatively characterize the size-dependent effect on the energy gaps of nanostructures.}

  abstract = {Delocalization error associated with the presently used density functional approximations is one of the main sources of errors which plague density functional theory calculations. In this paper, we give a comprehensive review on scaling correction (SC) approaches developed recently for reducing the delocalization error. The global and local SC approaches impose the rigorous Perdew-Parr-Levy-Balduz condition that the total electronic energy should scale linearly between integer electron numbers, on systems involving global and local fractional electron distributions, respectively. After presenting the theoretical background and mathematical formulation of scaling corrections, we demonstrate that they lead to universal alleviation of delocalization error. This is exemplified by the substantial improvement for the prediction of a wide range of electronic properties, including Kohn-Sham frontier orbital energies and band gaps, dissociation behavior of molecules, reaction barriers, electric polarizabilities, and charge-transfer species. The encouraging performances of SC approaches highlight their practicality and usefulness, and also affirm that an explicit treatment of fractional electron distributions is essentially important for reducing the intrinsic delocalization error. The existing limitations, the remaining challenges, and the future perspectives of SC are also discussed. Moreover, the SC approaches are compared with some existing methods attempting to remove the self-interaction error, such as the Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction, the local hybrid hyper-generalized gradient approximations, and the rangeseparated density functional approximations. The unique advantages of SC suggest that it could open a novel and potentially paradigm-changing route for advancing density functional theory methods towards chemical accuracy.},

Subprograms used:Cat IdTitleReferenceAEAK\_v2\_0wannier90CPC 185(2014)2309 Nature of problem: The Brillouin zone of a supercell is smaller than that of a primary cell. It makes the supercell energy bands more crowded. The crowded energy bands are outright difficult, if not impossible, to be compared with experimental results directly. Besides, the intra-supercell translation symmetries are hidden in the supercell band structure calculations. In order to compare with experiments and catch the hidden symmetries, we have to unfold the supercell energy bands into the corresponding primary-cell Brillouin zone. Solution method: The electron wavefunction is reconstructed from Wannier functions and Hamiltonian parameters, which are produced by Wannier90 package. Then by using fast Fourier transformation (FFT), we get the Fourier components of the reconstructed wavefunction. The unfolding weight is calculated from the Fourier components, based on group theory and its special form for plane-wave basis. Unusual features: Simple and user-friendly input system. Great efficiency and high unfolding speed. Running time: System dependent, from a few minutes to several hours.},

However, obtaining EPCs through fully first-principles methods is notably challenging, particularly for large systems or when employing advanced functionals. Here we introduce a machine learning framework to accelerate EPC calculations by utilizing atomic orbital-based Hamiltonian matrices and gradients predicted by an equivariant graph neural network. We demonstrate that our method not only yields EPC values in close agreement with first-principles results but also enhances calculation efficiency by several orders of magnitude. Application to GaAs using the Heyd--Scuseria--Ernzerhof functional reveals the necessity of advanced functionals for accurate carrier mobility predictions, while for the large Kagome crystal CsV3Sb5, our framework reproduces the experimentally observed double domes in pressure-induced superconducting phase diagrams. This machine learning framework offers a powerful and efficient tool for the investigation of diverse EPC-related phenomena in complex materials.},

  abstract = {Electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions are pervasive in condensed matter, governing phenomena such as transport, superconductivity, charge-density waves, polarons, and metal-insulator transitions. First-principles approaches enable accurate calculations of e-ph interactions in a wide range of solids. However, they remain an open challenge in correlated electron systems (CES), where density functional theory often fails to describe the ground state. Therefore reliable e-ph calculations remain out of reach for many transition metal oxides, high-temperature superconductors, Mott insulators, planetary materials, and multiferroics. Here we show first-principles calculations of e-ph interactions in CES, using the framework of Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+U) and its linear response extension (DFPT+U), which can describe the electronic structure and lattice dynamics of many CES. We showcase the accuracy of this approach for a prototypical Mott system, CoO, carrying out a detailed investigation of its e-ph interactions and electron spectral functions. While standard DFPT gives unphysically divergent and short-ranged e-ph interactions, DFPT+U is shown to remove the divergences and properly account for the long-range Fr\"ohlich interaction, allowing us to model polaron effects in a Mott insulator. Our work establishes a broadly applicable and affordable approach for quantitative studies of e-ph interactions in CES, a novel theoretical tool to interpret experiments in this broad class of materials.}

Many methods have been proposed to extract information about bonding from quantum chemical calculations, the majority of them resorting to molecular orbitals as basic descriptors. Here, we present a method called self-attractive Hartree (SAH) decomposition to unravel pairs of electrons directly from the electron density, which unlike molecular orbitals is a well-defined observable that can be accessed experimentally. The key idea is to partition the density into a sum of one-electron fragments that simultaneously maximize the self-repulsion and maintain regular shapes. This leads to a set of rather unusual equations in which every electron experiences self-attractive Hartree potential in addition to an external potential common for all the electrons. The resulting symmetry breaking and localization are surprisingly consistent with chemical intuition. SAH decomposition is also shown to be effective in visualization of ...}

The book gives a clear exposition of the elements of the physics of perfect crystalline solids. In discussing the principles, the author aims to give students an appreciation of the conditions which are necessary for the appearance of the various phenomena. A self-contained mathematical account is given of the simplest model that will demonstrate each principle. A grounding in quantum mechanics and knowledge of elementary facts about solids is assumed.

The Perdew-Zunger SI correction (PZSIC), when applied in conjunction with the local spin density approximation (LSDA), improves the description of many properties, but overall, this improvement is limited. Here, we propose a modification to PZSIC that uses an iso-orbital indicator to identify regions where local SICs should be applied. Using this local-scaling SIC (LSIC) approach with LSDA, we analyze predictions for a wide range of properties including, for atoms, total energies, ionization potentials, and electron affinities and, for molecules, atomization energies, dissociation energy curves, reaction energies, and reaction barrier heights. LSIC preserves the results of PZSIC-LSDA for properties where it is successful and provides dramatic improvements for many of the other properties studied. Atomization energies calculated using LSIC are better than those of the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and close to those obtained with the strongly constrained and appropriately normed meta-GGA. LSIC also restores the uniform gas limit for the exchange energy that is lost in PZSIC-LSDA. Further performance improvements may be obtained by an appropriate combination or modification of the local scaling factor and the particular density functional approximation.}
