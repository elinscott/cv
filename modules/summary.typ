I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Paul Scherrer Institute in the group of Prof. Nicola Marzari, researching methods to improve density functional theory (DFT). Taking inspiration from the properties of the exact functional and DFT's systematic errors, I (and others) have shown how to construct inexpensive corrections that drastically improve DFT's performance.

Career highlights thus far include...
- Receiving (a) the _Prince of Wales Award_ for the most outstanding student completing an undergraduate degree at the University of Otago, and (b) the _Cambridge-Rutherford Memorial Scholarship_ to enable doctoral studies at the University of Cambridge.
- Designing, developing, and releasing the #link("https://koopmans-functionals.org/")[koopmans] code, a package that implements Koopmans functionals. I am the lead author of this code. The code has attracted wide interest: an online tutorial had over 200 attendees; it is being used by industrial partners.
- Supervising Yannick Schubert's master's project and thesis. He said that "thanks to (Edward's) good choice of topics and guidance... achieving good results felt easy. Working with (Edward) was very motivating and a perfect start to a scientific career".

//   I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland) in the group of Prof.\ Nicola Marzari. I am researching methods for improving the performance of density functional theory (DFT). Taking inspiration from known properties of the exact functional and our knowledge of the systemic errors of DFT, I (and others) have shown how to construct inexpensive corrections to DFT that drastically improve its performance.

//   I am always looking for new opportunities where I can apply my expertise in developing density functional approximations and my coding skills to create the next generation of state-of-the-art computational methods for materials science and quantum chemistry.
