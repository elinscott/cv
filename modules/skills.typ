== Programming


I am a confident programmer, with experience in various languages implementing complex algorithms (primarily in the context of electronic structure). I routinely employ good programming practices such as testing, documentation, and CI/CD.

I am the lead developer of #link("https://koopmans-functionals.org")[koopmans], an open-source package for performing Koopmans functional calculations. I am a contributor to #link("https://www.onetep.org")[ONETEP], a commercially available scientific DFT code, and I was a developer of TOSCAM, an open-source DMFT code.

In addition to my formal training in scientific computing, I voluntarily attended #link("https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/L42/")[Machine Learning and Algorithims for Data Mining], a master's course on machine learning. I also enjoy coding competitions such as #link("https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/")[Google Hash Code], #link("https://projecteuler.net/")[Project Euler], and #link("https://www.codingame.com/home")[CodinGame].

== Supervision and mentoring
I am currently co-supervising Marija Stojkovic (PhD; EPFL; 2021--present).

I supervised Yannick Schubert (Masters; ETHZ; 2021--22). He said that "thanks to (Edward's) good choice of topics and guidance... achieving good results felt easy. Working with (Edward) was very motivating and a perfect start to a scientific career." Two papers resulted from this work.

While not formally being their supervisor, I also helped...
- F. Haddadi (PhD; EPFL) with DFT+_U_+_J_ calculations; a paper resulted from this work.
- H. Lee (PhD; King's College London) with DMFT calculations on transferrin; a paper resulted from this work, of which I am the last author.
- M. A. Al-Badri (Master's and PhD; King's College London) with DMFT calculations on hemocyanin; a paper resulted from this work.
- S. Mansur (PhD; Cambridge) with linear-scaling DFT calculations on carbon nanotubes; two papers resulted from this work.

== Grant writing
I have written and received several grants (e.g. an EPSRC capital grant for over 50k NZD of computing hours). I have also assisted with writing grant applications (e.g. #link("https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/213082")[SNSF Grant 213082]; awarded approx. 2M NZD and ranked in the top category of all applications).

== Service and Outreach
- I have reviewed articles for _Phys. Rev. Lett._ and _Phys. Rev. B_
- I have helped run tutorials on koopmans #link("https://youtu.be/uaHWhCZoDAk")[ðŸŽ¥], Quantum ESPRESSO, and ONETEP
- I am on the PhD committee of D. Tang (University of Zurich; 2023--present)
- I assisted at information days at EPFL and Cambridge, introducing high school students to computational materials science research
