  abstract = {A DFT+U-type corrective functional is derived from first principles to enforce the flat plane condition on localized subspaces, thus dispensing with the need for an ad hoc derivation from the Hubbard model. Small, molecular test systems at the dissociated limit are used to compare the functional form against several previously proposed DFT+U-type functionals. The functional derived here yields relative errors below 0.6\% in the total energy of the dissociated s-block dimers as well as the dissociated H+5 ring system, a challenging test case in which the asymmetric, tilted flat plane condition applies. In comparison, bare PBE and PBE+U (using Dudarev's 1998 Hubbard functional) yields relative energetic errors as high as 8.0\% and 20.5\%, respectively.}

Using the infinite-separation-limit technique, this Communication proves the convexity condition for any formulation of DFT that is (1) exact for all v-representable densities, (2) size-consistent, and (3) translationally invariant. An analogous result is also proven for one-body reduced density matrix functional theory. While there are known DFT formulations in which the ground state is not always accessible, indicating that convexity does not hold in such cases, this proof, nonetheless, confirms a stringent constraint on the exact exchange‚Äìcorrelation functional. We also provide sufficient conditions for convexity in approximate DFT, which could aid in the development of density-functional approximations. This result lifts a standing assumption in the proof of the piecewise linearity condition with respect to electron count, which has proven central to understanding the Kohn‚ÄìSham bandgap and the exchange‚Äìcorrelation derivative discontinuity of DFT.}

This generalizes the well-known constancy condition, related to static correlation error, in approximate density functional theory. The magnetic analog of Koopmans‚Äô theorem in density functional theory is also derived. Moving to fractional electron count, the tilted-plane condition is derived, lifting certain assumptions in previous works. This generalization of the flat-plane condition characterizes the total energy surface of a finite system for all values of electron count ùëÅ and magnetization ùëÄ. This result is used in combination with tabulated spectroscopic data to show the flat-plane structure of the oxygen atom, among others. We find that derivative discontinuities with respect to electron count sometimes occur at noninteger values. A diverse set of tilted-plane structures is shown to occur in ùëë-orbital subspaces, depending on chemical coordination. General occupancy-based total-energy expressions are demonstrated thereby to be necessarily dependent on the symmetry-imposed degeneracies.}

These corrections act on a set of localized orbitals that, in periodic systems, resemble maximally localized Wannier functions. At variance with the original, direct supercell implementation (Phys. Rev. X 2018, 8, 021051), we discuss here (i) the complex but efficient formalism required for a periodic boundary code using explicit Brillouin zone sampling and (ii) the calculation of the screened Koopmans corrections with density functional perturbation theory. In addition to delivering improved scaling with system size, the present development makes the calculation of band structures with Koopmans functionals straightforward. The implementation in the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO distribution and the application to prototypical insulating and semiconducting systems are presented and discussed.}

Despite this, we show that Bloch symmetry can be preserved and it is possible to describe the electronic states with a band-structure picture, thanks to the Wannier-like character of the variational orbitals. We also present a method to unfold and interpolate the electronic bands from supercell (Œì-point) calculations, which enables us to calculate full band structures with Koopmans-compliant functionals. The results obtained for a set of benchmark semiconductors and insulators show very good agreement with state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory and experiments, underscoring the reliability of these spectral functionals in predicting band structures.}

The effective characterization of MHPs requires accurate and efficient methods for the calculation of electronic structure. Koopmans compliant (KC) functionals are an accurate and computationally efficient alternative to many-body perturbation theory using the GW approximation but have yet only been validated on a small number of simple materials. In this work, KC functionals were applied to the more complex case of Cs2TiBr6 and gave a zero-temperature fundamental gap of 4.28 eV, in close agreement with the value of 4.44 eV obtained using the accurate, but more computationally expensive, evGW0 approach. The temperature-dependent renormalization of the bandgap has also been investigated and found to be significant. Agreement with the experimental optical bandgaps of 1.76‚Äì2.0 eV would also require the inclusion of exciton binding energy.}

The success of these functionals relies on capturing the effects of electronic screening through scalar, orbital-dependent parameters. These parameters have to be computed for every calculation, making Koopmans spectral functionals more expensive than their DFT counterparts. In this work, we present a machine-learning model that -- with minimal training -- can predict these screening parameters directly from orbital densities calculated at the DFT level. We show on two prototypical use cases that using the screening parameters predicted by this model, instead of those calculated from linear response, leads to orbital energies that differ by less than 20 meV on average. Since this approach dramatically reduces run-times with minimal loss of accuracy, it will enable the application of Koopmans spectral functionals to classes of problems that previously would have been prohibitively expensive, such as the prediction of temperature-dependent spectral properties. More broadly, this work demonstrates that measuring violations of piecewise linearity (i.e. curvature in total energies with respect to occupancies) can be done efficiently by combining frozen-orbital approximations and machine learning.},
